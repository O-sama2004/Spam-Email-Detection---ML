this is a great and attentive company attends to your emails and concerns however this particular fish is somewhat dry for king salmon it is supposed to be oily this is not the fish comes in a pouch more like canned tuna it is just ok but i would not purchase this again for the price very similar to chicken of the sea tuna,-1
i do not mind subtle but i thought outside of peppery on the back of the throat it seems quite tasteless i imagine some like it this way but i would like more green and olivevy,-1
not much to say here literally a cardboard shipping box filled with k cups looked like somebody just grabbed a handful and just threw them in a box and sent them off this may not bother some but to me this is poor presentation i would have expected something similar to what you find in stores an individual manufacturer is type boxing sent in a shipping box frankly i worried about the integrity of the product how would i know who or where this product came from for all i know someone picked them from a refused batch and simply threw them in a box and called it good additionally upon further inspection the k cups looked a little dirty it appeared that they had collected dust not sure if this was due to the packaging or simply bad product i guess that is about it i can not really speak to the actual coffee itself since i did not try it i should be fair and say upon calling amazon with my concern they were happy to refund me entirely and asked that i dispose of the product since it is a non returnable item i will be tossing this,-1
do not let the limited of stars fool you like they did me they talk about breast milk being liquid gold well mine leaked is so far it may work well for solids but i purchased along with other brands for milk storage the first thawing leaked about of breast milk all over my mom is fridge shelf leaving only a drop or in the bag being aware of this i thawed a second bag of about of breast milk in a clean bowl to have it leak completely out there are better products out there that are biodegradable i have used them with no problems so there is no reason to settle on this product it is quite possible that i had a bad lot but when i work that hard to leave a sitter my mom with enough milk for my kid and it is wasted it is devastating fortunately i left her with too much milk so my child did not go hungry i will be contacting the manufacturer regarding this issue so they can try to resolve this matter i would not recommend,-1
this is a pretty bad product whatever the manufacturer intended taste was not a priority,-1
what we were hoping for something a little more like the picture we were especially excited to try chocolate glazed donut and pumpkin spice what we hazelnut caramel vanilla french wild mountain cinammon southern butter mocha nut french vanilla supremesadly we already have entire boxes of wild mountain blueberry and caramel vanilla creme and the ones we were most interested in from this bunch we only got one or two of my mistake for not reading the reviews but i disagree with the guy who said that the description covers the sellers behind when it comes to variety the description says that a buyer will get a wide variety and i hardly think flavors comprising more than half of the package qualifies as wide variety i am extremely disappointed with this purchase if i would have bought these flavors on the keurig website i would have paid less per k cup than i paid for this package and i paid the higher price specifically for the variety i do not feel i got what i paid for and i think amazon should not allow this seller to continue falsely advertising final note the k cups came in a paper bag with no visible expiration dates one of them was punctured on top considering some of the other reviews i am worried about whether or not these k cups are even good anymore some of the other reviews suggest that at least some people received theirs in a box with expiration dates included,-1
while i have liked the other products in this line using this was a disaster my scalp has been itchy with signs of dandruff and i thought since the other products were so helpful this would be good as well yikes for starters there are no directions on the jar so what to do it is very greasy but i took a handful and rubbed it into my scalp and massaged so far so good i left it on my scalp for the rest of the evening to give it a chance to work the horror started when i tried to wash it out after shampooing it three times i gave up and just let it dry the next morning i was a mass of greasy looking curls i will be washing my hair every day until i get rid of this but i certainly will not try it again,-1
ordered dozen red roses and was assured delivery by february not only did the roses never arrive but i have yet to recieve any replies to my enquieries horrible horrible service,-1

i have not had a werther is candy for a long time so i bought the little box of sugar free had a couple and then read the ingredients which include acesulfame k look it up in my opinion it is poison worse than aspartame that companies use in diet soft drinks that affects the circulation of the brain i see more and more people reading the labels on products in the aisles of the supermarkets read the labels,-1
i have purchased a few of the enjoy life faux cookie products and although the price and quantity were hard to digest i thought the taste was more than tolerable i returned the faux granola because it was too hard a bowl of pebbles literally but it may have been on the store shelf too long btw you can not see inside the package or any other enjoy life package for that matter then the perky is rice crunch i purchased and enjoyed for months changed the label had the enjoy life logo on it and ounces less product at a higher price okay the times they are a changin and i moved on last week i purchased the chewy on the go bars sunbutter crunch the taste was good what more do i deserve however it was a marketing triumph four dollars and forty nine cents for diminutive bars at least compared to the packaging the bars are about two thirds the size of the foil wrap they come in add in the dead space in the box and you got what used to be referred to as a rip off in a health food store no one can hear you scream,-1
i really tried to like these i do not even remember ordering them on line as they are in my local supermarket first you have to get over the fishy smell when you open them even after rinising well they smell and then they are mushy i have tried them several ways and to me i would rather just eat a smaller portion of pasta as these do not satisfy at all,-1
this bag is way too small for larger dogs my yellow lab weighs approximately pounds i wish they indicated what size dog these bags were for although the bag is usable i would not recommend it for a larger dog,-1
i have not tried this popcorn it is actually for a deployed marine however i looked at the package and laughed when i opened it i had been dollars for package of popcorn seller your picture is very deceiving,-1
arm hammer is baking soda is aluminum free they just do not write it on their packaging i was not sure so i called them and they said there is no aluminum in it and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally this leads me to believe that there just is not aluminum in baking soda and researching it showed me that there might have been in the past but not anymore and not for a long time i resent that bob is red mill writes aluminum free on their package and then charges a premium for their product it is also arsenic free i hope if they label it arsenic free will we assume other brands are not i do not like that kind of marketing,-1
this product is not a toy it is a real energy drink with the imfamis title romulan ale it tastes great and was rare gift i could present to a fellow trekker,-1
cute idea but box arrived creased and some of the candy stale did not live up to it is promise for the price this was a birthday gift for my husband,-1
for discs when it is only from tassimo could have sworn that the description indicated that one order is for packs what a rip off,-1
when you click on enlargen image that is the exact size of the item i think like many others the picture makes you think its bigger no it is not i laughed when i received it because i was expecing bigger boxes to send as a gift to two important people i am embaressed to give it because of that hey here you go pieces of chocolate a few pretzels and couple cookies on a tight budget sorry lol,-1
i was hoping for something that tasted similar to a w diet cream soda this was not even close not sure what it tastes like but i did not like it i have not liked all the sodastream flavors i have tried but this is the first i actually disliked a friend of mine tried it the same attempt and she did like it so it takes all kinds,-1
this is the worst tasting protein i have ever eaten it is the indiana jones and the crystal skull of the protein world,-1
i am gluten intolerant and low and behold it had wheat in it so i gave it someone who could use it,-1
check out the nutrition facts right below the product name on the amazon page is the manufacturer hoping that uninformed consumers have heard the word omega somewhere and think that it is necessarily good for them nature is path does not tell us which omega or omega it contains beneficial omega are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax omega are generally what we get from corn fed stockyard beef or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil note that this product contains mg of omega and mg of omega more than twice as much of omega as omega the typical god awful american diet contains a ratio of omega to omega nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a ration of omega to omega studies are indicating that omega help the cardiovascular system reduce inflammation may have a helpful role in preventing cancer improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias are these studies far enough along to be conclusive no are they pointing us in some healthy directions yes are positive results encouraging more studies not just lab studies but human studies yes the most positive results so far indicate that omega are very good for our hearts so you get grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola flax seed raisins hemp seeds and sunflower seeds what are they using these fiber rich foods for the box you also get mg of sodium and fourteen grams of sugar along with some saturated fat i have been looking for healthy snacks for my pregnant daughter and i am shocked to see that there is no nutritional value in any of the bars produced by nature is path organic i decided to check out nature is path cereals etc and found the same garbage the words organic nature and nutrition have been prostituted by a lot of greedy companies but this is the most egregious example i have seen in a while i would like to see amazon pull these products if we stop buying them and the market disappears so will the products in the meantime we need to keep educating ourselves and sharing what we learn we need to keep up pressure on the grocery stores supermarkets food banks and places we go when we can not to get to or afford our co op we need to keep ourselves our children our grandchildren and our neighbors healthy well nourished and strong best to all,-1
this coffee was extremely weak and did not taste well i do not recommend wasting your money on it,-1
i could barely taste the flavor it is so sweet i gave two stars instead of only one because it is really my fault not the maker i did not doing my usual thorough research a minimal google search would have uncovered the fact that sugar is ingredient and corn syrup is yuk i have to say if something taste good i could give a good gosh darn what the color is they add red dye oh why or why must they add dye here is the ingredient list sugar corn syrup natural anise flavor color added including red maybe i can crush em up add flavor and something else to dilute sugar they may be savable oops that is my hoarder tendency talking,-1
the anchovies are outstanding so is the packaging the price was good but not outstanding about cents per can less than the grocery the problem is that they have an expiration date of something like hello who can go through cans of anchovies in less than months perhaps that is the reason for the very reasonable price but at that point i think rather than being sold by amazon they should be at the dollar store or deals com note i purchased these about months ago,-1
the service for return was poor the product reached me melted and fully bloomed chocolate was white with spots and streaks on the surface though this is something that can be reused by melting not for the seeding for which i would needed this they were not agreeing for return for a product that reached me in a form that was not acceptable i had to explain my need and purpose they did not refund my previous shipment or tax nor did they pay for the return shipment i ended up paying for the return shipment the product is a lot costly through this vendor actually double its price i bought a block of the same chocolate from a local callebaut vendor please research your local listings stop buying through these channels if you want callebaut chocolates call the number in the callebaut website and get the contacts of the local distributor while through this vendor the milk white chocolate for costed me close to with shipping i bought the block from the local distributor for just,-1
i have been drinking and enjoying the gevalia swiss hazelnut since i purchased my tassimo machine a year ago and would routinely buy it in and packs from amazon i recently noticed that the packaging had changed but assumed it was packaging only i was wrong the coffee in the new packaging is made with a new formula and it is horrible overly sweet and artificial tasting you can not even taste a hint of coffee flavor stay away from this blend my hope is that this is just an issue with a production run or this blend and the other redesigned gevalia t discs actually taste like coffee update i called tassimo direct and complained about the new gevalia swiss hazelnut t discs they were nice enough to offer me a refund exchange and i went ahead and ordered replacement t discs in a different blend i hope these will work out much better i encourage those that are unhappy with this new product to call them voice a complaint and get a refund exchange,-1
i received my order in april and was disappointed to see that the expiration date on all three packages of coffee is june the same bags of starbucks at the grocery are usually almost a year out for the expiration date i will not be buying coffee online again otherwise the service and shipping were just fine i am almost always happy with my purchases from amazon this is a rare exception,-1
why does this bone have to contain chicken meal and poultry flavor it is a peanut butter bone the reason i purchased it is because it was advertised as peanut butter my dog has a chicken sensitivity and would have gotten the runs like mad had i not read the label before giving it to him rather than return it because the shipping would have cost the same as what i paid for the item i took the filling out and gave him the plain bone i will refill it with some regular jiff if need be it would have been helpful for the company to disclose the ingredients in these so called peanut butter flavored things chicken is not peanut butter,-1
i ordered these truffles and it showed up in one giant melted heap of chocolate the chocolate was good however i used it to make fondue careful with the shipping though maybe say delivery would be best,-1
i have heard about the benefits of this type of fat and so finally bought some when it was on special here it was still sort of expensive but i had heard so many good things about it i bought it i now have a lot of it in my pantry the coconut flavor is very strong i thought that perhaps it would cook off but it does not nobody liked the flavor of coconut in food that are not supposed to have coconut therefore i only use it when i am cooking stir fry or asian then it is fine but it is a lot of product to have around for or meals a month,-1
this soup has a lot of sand in it i could not choke it down when i tried it last week it is a quick meal but it is no fun eating soup n sand chowder they need to improve on their quality control or discontinue the product all together avoid this stuff,-1
this coffee is finely ground so it has a good powdery consistency typically this means you will need to use less of it for brewing my wife and i like strong coffee but this coffee is very strong almost to the point that it is muddy the coffee smells like vanilla that is not an issue however i feel that the coffee blend overpowers the vanilla flavor the coffee appears to be so darkly roasted that you taste more coffee than vanilla this coffee tastes better with milk added which helps cut through the bitterness of the blend the bag is typical packaging designed to keep the coffee fresh once opened it can be folded down and sealed with an attached wire clip the bag is imprinted with a bonus take the empty bag to a starbucks and you get a free tall coffee it is coffee but not something i would enjoy on a regular basis this may be a once a week blend for me it is just too strong and lacks a clear vanilla balance,-1
omg is anyone reading what is in this crap mineral oil and petroleum two no no is for heathy hair and scalp what is wrong with these people that shit clogs the pores on the scalp and hair follicle why would anyone looking to maintain hair health use this,-1
i do not know how anyone could rate this so called cat food above a star it is crud the food is cheap stuffed full of fillers my cats prefer to eat old and dried up fancy feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk it comes out of the cans like a hard lump the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart well it is not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick one of the major ingredients in all their flavors is montmorillonite clay yes the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud ie very similar to what cat litter is made from to show how bad it is even the raccoons and coyotes will not eat this junk they would rather eat carrion those that think this is good food i can not imagine the crud you have been feeding your cats before shame on you shame on anyone buying this crud go buy a selection of fancy feast classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats and it is excellent quality food puts this junk to shame and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk i wish i could give this crud negative stars it should not be allowed to be sold,-1
i just recieved starbucks caffe verona kcups from oranges to dollars loose in a cardboard box and many of the cups are swollen the aluminum lid has ballooned up there is no way to tell the freshness of the product and i am going to assume that because many have popped tops they are not fresh product having ordered many cases of kcups over the years i have never seen the likes of this it looks like they have taken these cups from many other boxes and threw them into a box without a care whatso ever to the quality of said coffee containers first and last time i felt like i have been slapped fortunately i happen to have two storage cases for kcups what if i did not and i was not even afforded the luxury of simple product packaging to have some form of containment done oranges to dollars you made lemons into lemonade and a nice profit,-1
i thought since most of the chicken helpers are not bad that this would be good as well boy was i wrong it has a sweet sickening taste i could not stomach more than one bite not sure how this one got past the taste testers but they were way off,-1
i planted the spores just like the directions said and still nothing is growing its been one and a half months since i planted them i would not recommend this product to anyone,-1
i can not figure out how to load the trap it comes with two metal levers which you are to use to set the spring this will require some strength i would sent it back but i beleive there is a restocking fee,-1
how can any coffee latte with the primary ingredients of sugar and non dairy creamer which is actually hydrogenated oil be marketed as healthy in order to have a therapeutic dosage of ganoderma lingzhi the shell of the spore must be broken and you have to have well over of the lingzhi ganoderma based upon the person is weight and condition to be effective nice tasting coffee but not a healthy coffee you would do better going to get some folgers and keep the money in your pocket,-1
these do not have the texture of a regular jelly belly they are super waxy and the flavors are not pleasant that being said my husband and i go by the pet name of peas and carrots so it made a cute decorative candy dish at our anniversary party,-1
i received this product three months ago the first seeds started to grow then died within a few weeks the customer service center is taking a month or more to get back to customers two months later they say that they will send me a new package of seeds great except after one week the bulb burnt out after only a total of three weeks of use at the beginning and one this time so now these seeds are going to fail too ridiculous to pay so much for nothing,-1
my dog loved the food but two days later my dog was very sick i got the on sale so i was afraid it was expired but it wasnt now a cheep dog food turned into a expensive vet visit i thought i was doing him a favor by buying healthier food but not for my dog,-1
this iced tea is terrible this is the first stash product that i do not enjoy it is not iced tea it tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves,-1
i am a bacon fiend and was very excited to try baconnaise however after a small taste both my husband and i found it disgusting it tastes very chemically and not so much like bacon more like smoke flavoring we threw it all away,-1
the seed had a large amount of foreign matter in it i had to clean the seed ounce by ounce before i could use it,-1
tried these the other day put some in my mouth and some colors are so hard they are like rocks next thing i know i had a broken molar and over in dental work so buyer beware,-1
i do not know why everyone always seems to buy the chocolate hazelnut the hazelnut adds a bitter taste both during and after eating for a truly delicious rolled wafer cookie try the dark chocolate or the vanilla flavor both of them have the light and crispy outer cookie with the smooth yummy filling without any bitterness to destroy your enjoyment unless you really like hazelnut i would not recommend this cookie,-1
when i received the package i could not even brief my eyes it is soooooooooo tiny later i found one from local flower shop that has double size tree with only half internet price with shipping price,-1
this stuff is just plain disgusting i am so glad i found it at my grocery store and tried a box before i ordered a case from amazon as i normally do with cereal as another poster said where did they get the picture that appears on the box that is certainly not their product just gross,-1
received item with box smashed and bits of cookies out of box i looked at ingredients and it list hydrogenated oil yuk not for my dog in the trash it goes,-1
ok so i am deployed and thought i would buy something odd as far as beef jerky out of all the guys in my troop only person liked the jerky its not bad but its not good,-1
this happens to be my favorite coffee i always have it on hand however at per cup at the time of this review it is grossly overpriced i can currently buy one cup box at costco for a little less than x for the same quantity offered here for,-1
i was thrilled to have received these in the mail i used to eat these on a regular basis when i lived in california however these are impossible to open i mean to have the candy come out you have to press hard and use a lotta force to get the candy to push out so i would say maybe not as fresh as i would like after one i basically gave up i did not feel like a refund was necessary i was just disappointed,-1
apparently the original twix peanut butter pb bar has been discontinued and was replaced with this inferior version i guess at least a couple of years ago wish i had known that before ordering these bars yet another perfectly good product needlessly messed up by the manufacturer this version has a dark chocolate cookie which i guess is okay but it does not taste near as good to my tastebuds as the original pb bar with the standard cookie i guess i will have to look for something else the next time i get a peanut butter candy cookie urge that needs satisfying again for whatever reasons companies just can never seem to leave well enough alone go figure,-1
though it is not the diet version of sodastream ginger ale this concentrate still has a strong taste of artificial sweetener i was disappointed enough in the taste that after the first glass i threw out the remaining syrup,-1
while this sampler has a wide variety of bold flavored coffees half of the them are decaf if you drink coffee for a pick me up in the morning like i do and require a healthy dose of caffeine try a different sampler,-1
i have tried eating this a few times over the years but always seem to have an allergic reaction to it also it has an odd sweet taste that is unappealing,-1
prior to this purchase i had been a staunch supporter of dog nips brand previously free range brand chicken wrapped apple treats and perhaps it is just this particular merchant that sold me old outdated dog treats but in any case they made both my dog my parent is dog puke only after both dogs became sick did i closely inspect the bags for an expiration date the only thing i could find was an imprint on the front that said lot i took this as an expiration date of march i just recently bought the treats in october so they were very outdated when i received them the chicken had indeed appeared somewhat darker in color than other bags i have bought in the past but i did not think a whole lot of it after the dogs became sick however i felt i had to discontinue feeding them to our dogs bags approximately down the drain i was very unhappy with the purchase and i would not recommend ever buying doog food or treats online because of this experience,-1
the product is labeled as having zero grams trans fat but it also has partially hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel sic on the online ingredient list as of nov note that partially hydrogenated oil is trans fat the law in the united states allows them to claim zero grams if they have milligrams or less i will quote from the following articlemozaffarian et al trans fatty acids and cardiovascular disease the new england journal of medicine volume pages explain why this is really terrible i quote from page of this article however the producers of foods that contain lessthan mg of trans fatty acids per serving willbe allowed to list the content of trans fatty acidsas on the packaging so even consumers whoread the labels might unwittingly consume substantialamounts of trans fats in multiple servings for example several pats of margarine orseveral cookies per day here are a few more quotations from this article given the million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths fromchd coronary heart disease in the united near elimination ofindustrially produced trans fats might avert percent and percent chd events i e heart attacks each year these estimates are based on the replacementof trans fats with carbohydrates in practice however trans fats in partially hydrogenated oilswould most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated cis unsaturated which may haveadditional potential benefits as compared withcarbohydrates if such additional potential benefitis considered greater proportions of chdevents to percent might be averted note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans fat is astonishing since the authors point on on the first page that trans fat makes up only of the american diet in terms of calories and fat is high in calories the average consumption of industrially produced transfatty acids in the united states is to percent of total calories consumed they conclude on the basis of evidence from in vitro experimentalstudies dietary trials and prospective observationalstudies the consumption of trans fattyacids from partially hydrogenated oils providesno apparent nutritional benefit and has considerablepotential for harm professor willett has also written extensively about trans fat for a general audience in his book eat drink and be healthy the harvard medical school guide for healthy eating,-1
of all the coffee is i have bought this was the most dissappointing it is just instant coffee in a k cup in my opinion it was a total rip off do not by these unless you are a big fan of instant coffee,-1
was unhappy with the flavor i ordered under the assumption that the coffee would be the same quality that i have so enjoyed in restaurants i will not be re ordering this particular product if any one has ordered any douwe egbert product that meets the quality that is in restaurants please let me know there must be something that is out there thanks,-1
it is not overally strong which is nice but i only taste the spices it does not taste like pumpkin at all,-1
this gingerbread house kit is a p of s while working on the first one with my daughter one of the roofs collapsed as we were gently putting candy on top of it had to run to the store and buy another one same thing happened re tried using unbroken parts from both houses to piece it back together and the whole thing just fell apart i followed directions meticulously waiting nearly minutes instead of the suggested for the frosting to solidify i did not put any more pressure on the thing than necessary but the thing still broke later i am stuck with a sloppy sticky mess in my kitchen no gingerbread house and a disappointed on my hands this product sucked,-1
i do not like the taste which perhaps can be expected i am not a big coffee drinker however my daughter who likes coffee did not like it either and says she would rather go without than drink it again my expectations were for a very chocolate raspberry flavored coffee drink what i got was a harsh coffee taste with a slight aroma of raspberry and maybe a hint of chocolate i did not taste the raspberry or chocolate at all,-1
this formula gave my baby constant gas and constipation as soon as we switched brands he started having regular bms that were not hard nuggets anymore and much less gas,-1
the can of starkist solid white albacore i opened looked more like chunk light tuna with random bits of fish and other dark fish parts that one does not normally associate with solid white albacore in all my other experiences of eating solid white albacore from other brands the can usually contains a solid piece of fish from one part of the fish not chunks and bits from who knows where do not get me wrong i eat chunk light tuna as well and it is fine for sandwiches and everything but that is not what i paid for at least with the can i opened it seems like they either made a mistake or were cutting corners very disappointed,-1
this cereal smelled strongly or turpentine or chemical which indicates that the flax seed content has gone rancid it is likely due to heat during storage or shipment to us we had to throw it out it was a waste of money,-1
i used the frs powder for several months and had to stop using it because it caused stomach problems i was using one or two packets per day less than the recommended amount and i even tried diluting it more than recommended to make it less strong concentrated but it still caused problems the problems went away when i stopped drinking it while i like the taste and the convenience of the powder packets it is not worth the gastric disturbance,-1
the plants arrived well packed and on time it was planted in a patio pot with drip line and starter miracle grow pellet within a few days the healthy leaves turned bkack and dropped off leaving the center pod to grow within a week the leaves there turned black and now have dropped off also looking like one sick plant i took lots of photos over these days finally i replanted it in the soil near another banana tree with a drip line i have done all i could do and it looks like a loser it has not been in direct sun and we have not had a day maybe they will exchange for another banana yuma az,-1
at some point during this candy is life it was stored inappropriately i bought these to sell for cents each as a fund raiser however they had melted so much that the candy leaked out of the wrappers and re solidified making it impossible to unwrap ca not say this would be a consistent issue but i will not try it again,-1
i blame amazon com not ammish country for recommendig this otherwise good popcorn when i bought a hot air popper the instructions with the popper said do not use small kernel light popcorn they were right it all just flew out of the popper before it had a chance to pop,-1
my son hated it i tasted some and saw why it is tart and the barley gives it a weird smell and flavor yuck,-1
i must be careful in the future i have been very pleased with all my other amazon orders this was way too costly for small amount you receive also the cookies were not real fresh no more orders of this cookie,-1
i really loved this water i have been ordering it since february it does not have that strong mineral taste most of all it does come from fiji is natural spring water and not tap water disguised as mineral water unfortunately i can not order it any more due to amazon switching from fedex shipping to fedex smartpost i live in an apartment complex and the post office will not deliver it to my door as fedex did i really feel let down by amazon but i will definitely look for another way to order it i like it that much,-1
these sounded too good to be true and they were the taste of these is downright awful i have eaten a lot of protein bars and while these seem to have fewer chemicals and more wholesome ingredients than most they sure did not taste like it honestly these taste nothing like chocolate and really just taste like maltitol,-1
the products are ok but my experience with the people who work at flying noodle is what truly turned me off i would rather deal with local people who are honest and who can not hide behind their online anonymity it is too bad because there are so many good internet companies out there if you want more details just ask me personally,-1
i totally thought i would be getting boxes for that price i did not it was box with small snack packs i found this product on another site for a single box for what a rip off,-1
i ordered this discounted food knowing the discount would off set the shipping my cats love this cat food i have fed it to them for years and will keep buying it solid gold is an excellent brand never had any of the cat food recalls so i felt i made a wise decision even though the product listed did not include the size bag turns out the size was a lb bag still a savings with the discount i have also ordered through petfood direct never had a problem with their service or with their products the drawback was the bag was expired ordered and expired i am very disappointed i spent the money on expired food which i will not feed my pets there is a reason why a manufacturer puts an expiration date on their food so no i will not order this product again and i wonder if that was what the discount was all about getting rid of expired food the only way they could i will not order dry cat food on line again not through petfood direct not when their people do this to a customer,-1
when i first started my cats on wellness core i thought it was fabulous suddenly their fur was shiny and bright they liked it too but then reality set in a couple of bags later all of my cats were losing their fur in massively scary amounts i am not talking basic shedding either their fur was falling out everywhere this food was causing excessive hair loss all over their bodies on all my cats i was really worried because it was bad the rep at petco told me when i informed her of this problem that other customers had noticed the same problem in their cats i have read other reviews as well where people complained about a hairball problem with this food this was no ordinary hairball problem let me tell you in addition this food is absolutely not for cats with weight gain tendencies i reduced my lb male cat is daily intake to well under of this stuff plus a tbs of canned daily and he still gained weight on it my opinion is there is some vital problem with this food that would cause such hairloss either there is an ingredient in it that should not be there or there is something missing that should be there the wellness regular dry w grains caused flakes in my cats as well the wellness canned is the only thing i highly recommend from wellness,-1
would not recommend this product to anyone because it had chemical taste which my guests complained about when i served on a buffet type dinner i was so embarrassed,-1

i normally love earth is best products as does my son however tonight after i would given him half the jar i thought i would try some since it was a new flavor and i realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it i was appalled as this is my first child and i do not have any experience with this kind of thing i called poison control they said he would be ok and once i knew he was fine i got really angry i looked it up online and found that earth is best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it do not buy earth is best really disappointing,-1
i ordered the hard nougat because they were out of the bellino torone soft nougat which is excellent it is my favorite candy the hard nougat was a big disappointment teeth cracking hard taste ok but not worth the effort the mess i am planning on returning it found out that i can not return the food even more of a disappointment what a waste of money,-1
i have been drinking all kinds of tea for years i found this tea to be bitter and just not taste very good the flavor was not very pleasing to me at all it tasted like a chai tea gone bad green teas i have had do not have any spicey taste to them they have a smooth light pleasing flavor,-1
the package of the product is appealing until it is ready to use there has been several methods used to open this product pulling the nozzle twisting the nozzle squeezing the bottle snipping the nozzle etc what is the point of a nozzle that can not be used only by opening the entire top can the syrup flow which produces a sticky residue and does not pour to well how can you open this,-1
horrible product do not buy this product it smells horrible and check the ingredients it contains brown sugar sea salt etc etc,-1
try this on popcorn it is very good i bought mine direct from bell plantation the price here is not right i give it a four for flavor but take away for costing twice what it should,-1
this stuff tastes nothing at all like real coconut water it has a weird tangy fake coconut taste the reviewer who called it the jolly rancher of coconut water drinks was accurate it was absolutely disgusting i did not even finish the bottle yuck,-1
for you gotta be kidding that is per for colored water you can buy this stuff anywhere and i do for per bottle target local grocery etc,-1
this item was a part of an order that had two other items each from different sender i received the first two within a few days this one never showed up when it was already a few days late i had an order number so i checked where it was to see why i have not still gotten it it was delivered to san diego california i live in slc utah ok just a mistake no problem i emailed the company and they gave the shipping number to check where it is because they sent it first of all they gave me a wrong number luckily i had mine saved from when i made the order when i copy pasted the delivery to sand diego info and asked them what is up with that i never got the reply back i tried again a few days later asking do they intend to resend this item or will they give me a refung still no replay this is not a lot of money but it pisses me of that i ordered something through amazon and the company is doing this i will most definitely never order anything from them again and today i am contacting amazon to see what they can do about it it is not the money it is the principal,-1
please make sure to buy a small box first make sure you like it befor buying it i think it is terrible,-1
this has to be the worst coffee i have ever had the chance to drink my daughter summed it up in a simple statement it was like licking an ashtray i agree bad coffee bad purchase as another reviewer said no savings is worth bad coffee,-1
i am a jerky lover and decided to try out this turkey jerky and i was highly disappointed the jerky was way too sweet and had dry gritty texture almost like eating liver i like liver but i do not want my jerky tasting like it i never finished the first bag and eventually threw the other bags away,-1
this item arrived looking half dead with no leaves or blooms i followed the instructions but the bonsai never had a chance this was a total waste of money and unfortunately i bought two different bonsai is as gifts and they both did not live i would never recommend purchasing this product,-1
i was very keen to have my new cats take to this thing what a disappointment when one kitty tried to claw it the thing promptly fell over and now she will not go near the thing neither cat has given it even a little scratch yes it is cheap but now it is worthless,-1
it was cute seeing all of these candies together in one package but most of it can easily be bought at local mass market stores also many of the candies were simply stale and inedible not really worth the money unless you have money to throw away,-1
first lets talk about the fish i eat a lot of sardines and i was just giving these a try the fish does not taste very good i can tolerate a high fish taste but the ones in the roland cans taste pretty bad fishy now lets talk about the sauce the description says sardines in tomato sauce with chili to give you a heads up there was no chili not even a little hint of it in the sauce it was bland tomato sauce and lacked any seasoning i expected a bit of a kick from the sauce but i was disappointed its better to go with the ligo brand if you want to at least taste a bit of the chili so now i have a lot of sardines that i dont like,-1
as the title says i trashed it after a sip i made my wife trying that she had a sip and said yuck hope this helps you not buying this stuff,-1
ordered this to try some old school cocktails that called for it not realizing that orgeat is widely available as coffee shop syrup shots this would have perhaps been a better and cheaper because of the shipping costs choice it is usable at best,-1
the baby breeza worked great for a couple of months the machine started leaking grease from the driveshaft into the food it made my stomach turn to think i had been giving my son food with grease i bought this machine b c i did not want to give my son baby food from a jar and so that i know what he is eating i was very disappointed i also searched to see if other people have had the same problem and i was not the only one i ended up buying a ninja blender and a stovetop steamer,-1
like the writers of many other reviews i read i got a disproportionately high amount of plain special k around of my bowls i got no bowls of the kashi cereal the net weight of a bowl of plain special k is oz whereas the other cereals weigh in at around oz special k is also the cheapest cereal to make of the four making it extremely suspicious that many shipments of this assortment seem to be unbalanced in its favor i am pretty upset that i purchased a assortment that ended up containing only and an undesirable mix of those be warned based on the reviews here you are likely to have a similar experience,-1
purchased baronet is coffee izzy is blend coffee pods for bunn my cafe which works perfectly this blend had absolutely no flavor no aroma and was watery i tried first with oz of water then the second cup oz of water it just has no flavor and i wasted my money,-1
i was thinking that this annie chun is noodle bowl would be just as good as the others i have tried but i was wrong the sauce had an oily appearance and a horrible flavor,-1
nothing wrong with the sugar besides the fact it is so expensive and does not last very long but after fun and time taking experimentation i have found a perfect and cheaper substitute it is called turbinado sugar and i found some at the whole foods in st louis but i would imagine they sell it at all whole foods they sell it in bulk and it is per pound so in comparison to what you buy in the store or find on amazon after shipping pound of teavana tea costs for the same you can buy pounds of turbinado sugar and you use it in the same ratio that you use the german rock sugar so you get times the bang for your buck,-1
i have been eating powerbars for years and thought i would try a double chocolate kellogg is meal bar holy cow it is like biting into a ground up mixture of styrofoam and dirt that is been compressed into a semi solid then dipped in overly sweeten chocolate the beach sand residue left in my mouth from this thing is horrible i have got half the bar sitting here in front of me and i really do not think i can finish it off yuck judging from the other reviews maybe these gross awful things are an acquired taste or maybe my taster is just seriously out of whack whatever the case they are downright nasty even the smell is bad,-1
after buying my keurig i have done a bit of experimenting with different varieties of coffees available i have enjoyed other newman is own products so this one caught my eye i was disappointed i am not sure how they came up with extra bold in the name but i found it relatively weak i ended up drinking a couple saving one or two for potential guests that might like weaker smoother blends and gave the rest away,-1
cafe molido santo domingo coffee i bought bags bag would have been enough the coffee is too finely ground and very bland i have been to santo domingo and purchased coffee there in the grocery store that coffee was very rich and had a great flavor what happened to this coffee in transition is anyone guess i drink a lot of coffee this coffee is no comparison to a good columbian blend,-1
i have ordered salmon jerky from snackmasters before and really liked their product but it was a couple years ago i recently ordered a package from them again the jerky was so hard it was like chewing leather i do not mind my jerky on the harder side but my jaw hurt after a couple pieces i also found fish bones in my jerky which i think is unacceptable especially for the cost of the product,-1
our dog eats their dry food but won t eat their wet food i wish i could return the cans,-1
i was very disappointed in this product the ingredients say that it contains either cornstarch or tapioca starch the one i got used tapioca and that might have made the difference the powdered sugar was like plaster as another reviewer stated it was very lumpy and my frosting never got the silky texture i have gotten for years with the cheap o powdered sugars i bought in the supermarket,-1
this is the first paul newman product that i have tried that did not taste good the product is very nicely packaged but after that it goes downhill pretty quickly i have had healthy licorice before and it tasted much better than this product really really really disapointed,-1
if you are looking for a full bodied rich dark roast decaf keep looking the only way to make this coffee worth drinking is to use times the amount i usually use for a dark roast even then it is nothing special,-1
these were purchased for my mom who completely believed the new owner has changed the recipe she insisted she could taste a saltier flavor and ended up throwing away the crackers better luck next time,-1
i used to buy this sugar for years i do not eat much sugar but still this sugar is called turbinado sugar but is misleading i picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar and other brands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something how did i find out i needed just a sweet water few days ago i put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just pure white sugar crystals what a shame on the producer u can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well how do they color it who knows,-1
i ordered several bags of haribo gummy clown fish expecting soft and flavorful candy but received gummi candy that was harder than what i could get in the bulk candy bins at the local store very disappointed they seemed old and not fresh,-1
i bought these cakes at my local health food store they look nothing like the images on the box in which they come they have no trace of cocoa they have nothing of the lightness of actual pound cake they are heavy and too sweet they taste like a chunk of fat and sugar which is what they are the second ingredient after eggs is sugar and then vegetable shortening that especially the latter item should say it all,-1
i was extremely dissapointed in this product i purchased it because it did not hfc listed on the label hfc is not something that i can digest and therefore since this item can not be returned it is no use to me nor would i foster it on someone else,-1
there is very little meat in this food and there are toxic chemicals various meat by products lower quality than whole meat or meals and harder to digest than actual meat caramel coloring is only necessary when there is not enough meat caramel color may be carcinogenic liquid top sirloin flavor grilled chicken flavor flavoring is only necessary when the product has insufficient meat top sirloin flavoring is made from manure of cattle carageenan causes cancer including breast cancer read an interview with joanne tobacman md professor of internal medicine university of iowa at there are no vegetables in this food cesar has repeatedly stated that his entire goal in coming to the united states was to go to hollywood and be famous i think that that focus on fame and money is apparent in his approach to dog food give crummy food nice packaging and an appealing name that one is dog will eat it is no advertisement first the only thing one really has to do to sell dog food is make it so the dogs will eat it that the dog will eat it is no measure of the quality or benefit of the food dogs eat anything including manure which is part of this food as the meat flavoring,-1
i have been eating knorr lipton noodles for about years now they are simple to make inexpensive and tasty this particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department as far as all the knorr varieties go this is near the bottom of my list i will probably not be buying this one again this flavor along with the other two new flavors bacon cheddar and scampi are rather disappointing i would have expected more from knorr the discontinued beef lo mein asian side from knorr was much much better than this,-1
i have been gluten free for about years now and love my cookies i generally order schar products and love their vanilla sandwich creams which really are as good as or better than gluten cookies with glutino i feel it is hit and miss their crackers are generally delicious and i love their pretzels but these cookies tasted like styrofoam and the icing was super sweet not my favorite product from glutino if you did not care for these you might try the schar vanilla cremes they are amazing,-1
while i liked everything about the fruit strip nutritional value all fruit no sugar added texture etc the taste did not match the product is description the ripened raspberry tasted more like apple and pear which are the first two ingredients the raspberry flavor was nearly non existant,-1
i like bold coffe and historically have really enjoyed kona coffee or blend but this is bitter harsh and tastes like tree bark less expensive k cups are bold and smooth for example i like tully french roast the italian roast is about as bitter as the kona i am pleased i only puchased two boxes of this stuff,-1
i would have to agree with the other rating there is a sweet smell and taste i cannot pinpoint and truly do not care for it maybe its the lemon grass not sure but cannot tolerate it at all,-1
i regularly heat soup in a microwave at my office brands include campbell is progresso etc in microwavable containers like this hc product each requires a slightly different time to heat completely so the first time i heat a product i watch it carefully to determine that time i followed the hc directions removing the metal lid under the plastic cover and replacing the plastic cover our microwave is a relatively low wattage model compared to the watts assumed by hc on the label so i knew it would take longer than the minute seconds they recommend because it was lunch hour other people were waiting while the soup heated we were all startled when there was a loud bang from the microwave and the plastic cover blew off the top and the container jumped splattering soup all over the inside of the oven it took about five minutes and a lot of paper towels and water to clean up the mess the soup that remained tasted fine and the meat was more tender than normal for soup in microwavable containers that said i cannot recommend it nor will i buy it again i choose such soups for convenience not excitement i did report my experience to conagra parent company of hc but to date they have not responded,-1
i do not buy anything for my dogs that has propylene glycol in it there are so manyother treats on the market with healthy ingredients,-1
i hate the new and improved stride which i purchased for years i do not like the foil wrapper or the taste of the gum flavor does not last i have switched to orbit white bubblemint yum,-1
product did not ship well pasta broken into small pieces flavor profile was poor i like the idea of low carb pasta however,-1
i would not buy this product again if it was free i followed the directions to the letter and all i got was a sterile cup of soil that ended up molding over time when i tried to contact gimborn pet specialties about it noone ever responded to my emails or letters,-1
and did not work in the keurig because of this do not send damaged goods i would say this was percent of what i received not all percent did not work but of the so far i tossed about of the first was good would have liked more flavored coffees,-1
i picked this up right away when i noticed it was cheaper than anything else i mostly load my own freshly ground stuff in that kuerig cartridge or the eco cup the k cup coffee they sell in the stores sits there for weeks or months check the date in the square on the bottom and always buy freshest and it loses a lot of flavor i use the k cup coffee for emergencies until i get some fresh roasted beans so grading on the curve this stuff is on par with some of the staler k cups i have had i came at it with an open mind only noticing for sure it was instant when i took the cup out of the maker after brewing and noticed it was strangely light i peeled back the top and nothing it took my slow brain a minute to figure it out coffee crystals as good as starbucks instant i think faint praise but they do not tell you it is instant shame on them for that i will not be buying this again update september apologies they do tell you it is instant if you are good at reading fine print i have dropped my rating from stars to because the coffee is not really that good in fact i threw it away does not make sense economically even if you like instant coffee,-1
good price perfect size small packages but the first box box box all were stale a first for an amazon food product it is happened with others selling on amazon but never a product from amazon bummer,-1
when i purchased this i thought about a healthy smootie anywhere anytime but it does not taste very good not sweet and yummy enough sorry for being so technical,-1
here is the email i wrote to the lindt company after my first taste of the new version hello i have loved your excellence bar since i first discovered it years ago the slight tang of fruity notes was very unique and simply delightful also knowing that only the highest quality chocolate is made with enough cocoa butter to preclude the need for soy lecithin i was impressed that your excellence bar was soy free like many other americans i typically avoid soy for health reasons however your new version of the excellence bar is entirely a disappointment its bland flavor is not disagreeable but it certainly lacks the character of your previous recipe and i see that the quality of ingredients has also been sacrificed the bar now contains soy lecithin this chocolate no longer stands out from any other chocolate available on store shelves i will now be buying my chocolate from a different company but if at some future time you decide to resume your previous version of the excellence bar i will be pleased to buy from lindt again,-1
not only is this syrup hardly as natural as claimed it tastes terrible check out the ingredients and you decide how natural it is i will be sticking with pure maple from now on,-1
not really a good flavor if you are looking for something close to starbucks way to heavy on the pumpkin flavor not sweet enough maybe,-1
well i dont know about the product itself but i do know you are better off finding a local indian asian halal market in your are and buying from there if you dont have one then this would be the way to go a better one would be asking a relative that lives in a larger city to buy you some and ship it,-1
even if i go to the local starbucks down the street and purchase this item it is still only friend good luck trying to sell this for over per can i do not even think someone in their wrong mind would pay this,-1
the tiny nuts under the overwhelming ball of chocolate is not of the highest quality they looked a bit old and you can barely taste the macadamias too much chocolate that is not very rich and for a dark chocolate way too sweet you are better off buying roasted macadamias and a good quality dark chocolate and eating them together in one bite,-1
those posting that these cupcakes are amazing must not know what homemade cupcakes and icing are the cupcakes are not bad not very attractive as the one posting commented but that is because i actually filled the cupcakes full like the box said and they overflowed would have been better had it said to just fill them half way and make more cupcakes however the icing was terrible actually inedible and i love desserts and sweets and icing and will try anything but it does not even smell like good chocolate frosting i followed directions precisely used all fresh ingredients bought the day i made them and i ended up using my own homemade icing with the cupcakes rather than throwing the cupcakes and icing away and for the amount of work for the cupcakes i would rather make some from scratch they would definitely taste better very disappointing since i typically love ina and have had some of her other box mixes which were excellent,-1
we made this seasoning purchase based upon the item as pictured unfortunately the received seasoning is quite different from what was pictured to explain further lawry is made a significant change in their taco seasoning not for the better a number of months ago when they did so they also changed the packaging of the product we based our purchase upon the pictured seasoning the old and tasty seasoning yet what we received was the new and not so tasty seasoning which can be purchased at any grocery store not worth sending back but if what you are looking for is the good stuff avoid this one i finally think i am going to try my hand at making my own taco seasoning,-1
the bars taste good but they are really crunchy it is almost impossible to eat them and not make a huge mess of crumbs definitely not good for taking on the go to eat in the car,-1
i have been drinking earl grey for over years and sadly watched the demise of my favored vendors one by one after the last disappearance i tried the taylors on the basis of the reviews disappointment is not the right word it smelled strange out of the box and after brewing it properly discovered that it bore no resemblance to the dozens of different earl grey experiences i have had it is heavily dominated by the peaty nature of the chinese black tea base almost an oolong and the bergamot is barely detectable unique but not what i want de gustibus non disputandem,-1
i purchased this for my husband because he likes the name brand ideal which is made from xylitol this is not the same as ideal the texture is different and it has an aftertaste it tasted like and the texture also reminded me of truvia which i do not like at all if you like truvia made from the stevia plant then this will work for you but if you are looking for something comparable to ideal xylitol this is not for you,-1
the box contains empty chocolate shells the photo showed the shells filled with something of a lighter color which is misleading i bought this box as a gift to my wife who loved the heindl tourist chocolates during our recent trip to vienna the empty chocolate shells are good but she was underwhelmed,-1
the description claims this balsamic comes in jars i should have examined the picture more closely this balsamic comes in a plastic squeeze bottle there are already enough health concerns around plastic containers without adding something so acidic to the mix combine this with the heat encountered during shipping and the combo only gets worse note that this item is not eligible for return either,-1
it seemed easy enough to make basically just dump the little granules in a cup and add hot water stir to dissolve it then attempt to drink not sure what i was expecting maybe something like tea or like lemonade it was neither it was lemony sure but it was also really spicy like hot spicy a bit like drinking chili pepper water not my cup of tea as it were if you really like drinking spicy ginger perhaps you will like this guess i am not much of a ginger fan for me i will stick with green tea or peppermint this just did not sit well with me,-1
after reading several satisfactory reviews on amazon i purchased the zuke is turkey and taterz mini bakes my two dogs are not picky eaters and especially love turkey and potatoes my miniature poodle absolutely refused them my terrier took them in his mouth and immediately spit them out i have tried several times but the result is the same since the ingredients are all natural i took a small nibble myself to see why they taste terrible and the texture is awful this was a waste of money,-1
these chips are tasty but i am particular about the origin of the food i eat and did not expect these chips would be a product of thailand,-1
amazon allows a customer to purchase of these total yes you read that correctly for most babies this might last only a couple weeks who is amazon kidding why even offer it as a product at all i will give the revenue to diapers com instead since amazon will not take my money,-1
these do not remind me of pretzels at all they may be crunchy but they lack anything in the center and remind me of really crisp thin crackers rolled into sticks if they were crackers i would not buy them either but that might be because i do not like really crunchy crackers but instead ones similar to the glutino original crackers or ritz crackers where they have a slight more substance to them,-1
not many natural drinks that are energy focused have a warning on them for people with high blood pressure this one does since that is not explicit on the listing i was duped into getting this to review unfortunately i am not even going to chance it here is to full disclosure on products sold on amazon everything can not be in the disclaimer and most people do not read pages full of disclosures the least they could do is put a full copy of the product packaging on here since it is big shown clearly on the packaging,-1
the price was low so it was an acceptable risk to try it out i like jalepeno cheese and popcorn i like many kinds of flavored popcorn i like yaya is other cheese popcorn this jalapeno cheddar popcorn arrived a few days past the expiration date bummer okay so maybe it will be stale but who cares i will eat it i put a small handful of this popcorn in my mouth and it tasted terrible i kept chewing i had to give it a chance swallowed a little put a little more in my mouth and could not stand it any longer get it out of my mouth spit everything out it is the worst popcorn i ever tried the after taste kept coming back hours later and grossing me out my friend tried some too and said it was horrible the whole case went into the trash i was afraid to feed it to animals,-1
my dog would not eat it he took one snif and tried to cover it up do not waste your money,-1
it is beyond me why anyone owning a keurig coffee brewer would want instant coffee i usually read all reviews unfortunately i did not have time that day and did not want tomiss this friday special this is the way it was marketed to buyers on amazon grove square tm single cup coffee dark roast ct box i find this deceptive and unfairto unsuspecting customers this is instant coffee if you go onto amazon it now it states on someof the grove square products that it is instant coffee i use my keurig for makingtea and hot chocolate and have even bought the chai cups do not buy it is worse thanany instant coffee i have ever tasted and amazon will not let you return it does notdeserve the rating i had to give it to get this to post thank you and i hope this is helpful,-1
i bought the vegetable soup at a county fair expecting a hearty and varied vegetable soup but the soup is misnamed it should be called potato soup because that is all that is in it this soup is expensive so you would think they would at least include a few veggies but no they would rather pack in lots of desiccated potatoes to fool the customer save your money,-1
i normally enjoy all of the kavli crispbreads and was really looking forward to trying this one it is light crispy holds up well under heavier toppings such as vegetables and is low calorie however i found this product to be too salty even for a confirmed salt lover such as myself the salty garlic flavor can overwhelm many toppings especially those already containing salt a fresh sliced tomato with herbs no salt is fine adding a little salted hard cheese such as parmesan decimates the flavor of the cheese i ordered a subscription because the price was fantastic but i will be cancelling it and replacing it with another kavli crispbread product,-1
i love regular merengue cookies and i normally do not have a problem with sugar free but these cookies had a terrible taste and worse texture stick to the non sugar free,-1
i am totally dissatisfied with my encounter with nutricity my order was late damaged and incorrectly filled nutricity was uncooperative and difficult with the return process and failed to either replace my order or fully refund the damaged items their attitude was that they just wanted to get rid of me and they certainly did,-1
it is tough to review a food product since we all have different taste preferences so i focused on how this compares to splenda since it is made by the same company i use splenda exclusively as a way to control caloric intake i like the taste and find it comparably sweet to sugar without an aftertaste such as equal and sweet n low have for me most importantly i use splenda because it has no aspartame which i am allergic to nectresse also has no aspartame but unfortunately i found it to have an odd and very noticeable taste i am not sure if this is the monk fruit or the molasses but it is distinct it was unpleasant and downright wrong in iced tea i dumped a glass made with it so i decided to try it in plain greek yogurt i normally add splenda packets and a scoop of sugar free jelly to my yogurt i did the same with the nectresse the odd flavor was still noticeable though not unpleasant with the jelly just different however i also found that it was not as sweet i think another reviewer may be right this is more fruit sweet with a hint of tartness than sugar sweet the nectresse comes in thicker foil lined packets like the splenda essentials do i find these inconvenient you can not easily shake the product to the bottom of the bag to open and it is not as easily opened either overall this is not bad per se and could be an alternative for those who do not like splenda but need to avoid aspartame i would hazard a guess that those who prefer splenda will not like this i will finish the sample package i was sent as the taste is not as off putting in fruit based items like herbal tea or yogurt but i would not buy this regardless of the price,-1
i purchased this product for my brother is birthday as was forever saying that he thought chocolate covered bacon sounds so delicious i knew the vosges milk chocolate bacon bar would be in bar form as it says on the website but what i did not know is that the bar contained very very tiny pieces they turned out to be grains of bacon sparsely distributed after my brother open the gift revealing the chocolate bacon bar everybody at the party started laughing telling me that i was scammed i was utterly humiliated look at the photo of the piece of bacon on the box that to me infers that there is a piece of bacon inside that is covered in chocolate quite frankly i would not complain if there were at least bacon chunks inside the bar of chocolate not so i am now on the hunt for a recipe to make chocolate covered bacon at home i am not much in kitchen so this is a real chore for me and it is highly unlikely i will be able to make it myself like i said i am not much of a cook boooooooooo,-1
i ordered the babycook but when i received it it looked as if it was a returned item the packaging was opened and there were scuff marks on some of the parts i re ordered and i hope that the one is brand new because i really would like to start using this i have heard great things about this product but my rating was based on how i received the product and not the product usage itself,-1
last two purchases the oatmeal was green and had a very peculiar taste to it i am hoping the company checks their product more carefully as there have been many moms who have lost confidence in this product,-1
this honey is good but i can not understand why the price is changed so frequently one month ago i bought it at subscribe price this time i bought it at subscribe price but now it is from the price aspect i do not recommend it,-1
i have purchased these olives from amazon in the can they were excellent though roland still sells the cans amazon decided to stock these plastic tubs instead bad idea mine arrived with the top completely off the cardboard box soaked with brine and of the olives in the moldy cardboard box the entire mess was unusable amazon did their usual great job of customer service we received an immediate refund but the trashcan got the olives not us i would give this sad mess zero stars if i could last sad little detail is the big ready to ship label on the top of the container it clearly was not,-1
the noodles came out gummy and they stick together and clump i thought i just overcooked them at first but the second time i cooked them they still came out in clumps but were too toothy you will notice that the cooking water becomes very murky while cooking it too and so maybe the noodles are just too starchy i will never buy these noodles again but they get stars just because i love this company and their approach to food,-1
i ordered pack of i have been expected good coffee but i was very disappointed one of cut its packing and just messed coffee up in the box i had to throw away one now honestly i do not want to try it,-1
not good at all my family and i are big mac cheese fans we like the other chef boyardee pastas but this was no good very little flavor and super runny stick with the kraft easy mac much tastier and just as quick,-1
well it certainly is unique it tastes bad hot or cold i could taste no lemon at all just a bit of honey flavor came through thank goodness otherwise it is like you are drinking water that you grated fresh ginger in sprinkle it on your sushi or meat when you cook do not drink it by the way i love ginger but this stuff is pretty gross,-1
i am not a huge cookie fan i like my desserts fruity cheesy or frozen with chocolate fudge on top the one exception is ginger snaps i like them even when i am not in the mood for something cookie ish i like them with tea i like them with coffee i like them with pepper jack cheese everything goes with pepper jack also because they usually are not terribly sweet and when i go to the trouble of baking them they seem to last longer than other cookies i mean they still taste good the next day not that i can resist eating them all straight from the baking sheet but these ginger snaps are not right they are chewy and gritty stale but burnt in places i know it sounds like a manufacturing problem and i thought perhaps the unburnt not stale ones would be okay if they were rebaked nope i picked through the bag to find the snaps that were not burnt i put them in the oven to are crisp at a low temp for about five minutes in the end they still tasted bitter gitty stale and overly sweet the price is right at around a bag but i think you would be better off buying an old tried and true brand such as nabisco ginger snaps sweetish super crispy reliably cooked for an even crisp texture or anna is ginger thins my new favorite store brand of ginger snaps they are wafer thin spicy and go well with ice cream,-1
i used to eat this almost every morning now it says new great taste but its horrible not even extra brown sugar helps change it back please,-1
it is sugar and no substance do not feed this to your kids and they will thank you for it it is just white on white on white and a couple of zig zags did i mention the amount of sugar packed into these nasty things i do not know how i used to eat these stars,-1
considering the extra that one pays for organic products this product did not deliver for one thing it did not pass my smell or taste tests thyme is a fantastic herb and i expected the organic to be even more robust than non organic i understand that it is dried for packaging but even so i did not expect to have to struggle so much to extract it is aroma or develop its flavor profile in my dishes non chef that i am i have been around the kitchen long enough to know what i am working with when it comes to my favorite herbs and spices this brand does not measure up,-1
yuck i usually love sprout baby food and was so disappointed they are roasted so it is a orange mauve color which is okay but the flavor is really sour and strange there are better options for stage bananas i think i figured out why it is so bad i think the bananas tasted like they were really green when they roasted them,-1
order placed august pakcof cans ounces i have purchased this cat food several times in the past and my cats loved it however the last shipment on august disappointed me and my cats the design of the can has changed but that does not bother me i am very unhappy about the food itself it is now almost liquid and does not really fill up the can while it used to be solid firm all the way up to the lid like a good pate cat food should be my cats do not even like it anymore i would like to know if other buyers have noticed the difference or if by chance i received a shipment that is under par i certainly will not buy it any more and will no longer recommend it to anyone i would like for amazon to forward my comment to felidae why did they change the formula and make it worse changes like this damage a firm is good name in general best regards vera mottino,-1
i bought a lot of boxes of vita coco from amazon these past few months due to the sale special offers lately boxes both were the small size tasted great carton had a weird taste i said whatever and bought the larger size yuck i drank the first two and they tasted sour i compared them side by side with the other vita coco i had the smaller cartons and these taste really different i opened a few more to try and some were okay and others sour ugh i do not care how good some of these boxes are if they vary this much it is not worth it to me to try again edited to add i emailed vita coco and told them about this and they told me they had a bad batch the rep then mailed me a free box of cartons this batch was good they sent me some funky flavors instead of the original though still nice of them,-1
new improved recipe not really ovaltine should go back to the original formula new formula has more sugar less vitamins if your on the same page call ovaltine to request the original recipe call ovaltine,-1
i bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and i enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials my cats did eat this food in fact they really enjoyed it however after reading the ingredients and doing some research i completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats the first few ingredients are which indicates the most prevalent ingredients are water sufficient for processing liver wheat gluten and meat by products by products are not even a real meat by products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested we are talking beaks chicken feet eyeballs even chicken poop i would not recommend this product it is just not a good quality cat food i suppose you get what you pay for i think the only reason why it was cat approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because i usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy i recommend to stay far away from friskies as it is simply a very low quality filler food even though the price is quite inexpensive your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food because they will never feel full cats need to eat real identifiable pure meat and there just is not enough real meat in this food when purchasing a cat or dog food the most important thing to consider is the first ingredients just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself provided that you eat a typical not vegetarian or other restricted diet now that i know what to look for i usually buy my pets all natural foods such as natural balance blue buffalo halo or wellness all of those brands contain real whole meats that i myself would eat with no added fillers or low quality foods,-1
my girls a year old mini dachshund and an papillion mix love all things chicken they literally turn their noses up at most beef based treats they already love zuke is chicken mini naturals so i expected them to go wild for these z filets nothing doing i am not too impressed myself compared to the product description basted chicken filet what we received just does not match up i expected something chewier textured meatier and tougher what i found was not a filet which implies whole cut but a soft patty a pressed ground bits if i did not know better i would think it was veggie based i should have read the reviews first though i thought i could rely on the official product description and the overall excellent reviews these treats are described as ridged to help naturally clean dogs teeth and gums to promote healthy oral hygiene but what i received in the package which looks just like the package depicted is a thin flat and very soft which could not help clean teeth especially when they are not very chewy which does not matter anyway since my snooty dogs will not eat them i suspect their reticence has to do with the strong garlic smell coming off the patties i think it stinks but that is never stopped dogs from eating things before i even expected them to perhaps think i was giving them people food since our food is highly seasoned they did not buy it it is likely not chicken y enough for them who can tell i will not stop ordering zuke is products but i will be careful to read how reviewers describe them as opposed to promotional copy,-1
i bought this product and the soda stream jet just to experience the healthful benefits of sarsaparilla the word imitation does not appear in the product description the motto do not squeeze use fee is makes it seem even more deceptive what would i otherwise have had to squeeze imitation sarsaparilla,-1
it tastes fine to me but my son will take spoonfuls then spits it out green beans and spinach he can not keep down hot or cold he does not like this i still try now and then hoping he will change his mind he is months now since we started him at months and still does not like this he does like steamed green beans i cook but not this i have mixed this with other foods is the only way to get him to eat some because i know its good for him good price and value but not worth it if your child will not eat it,-1
this is really really hard i use it for baking and for topping treats like cakes yogurt etc this does not work well at all,-1
i knew i was rolling the dice with this mixed grab bag based on some of the positive reviews i took a chance could not be more disappointed one third of the k cups are the cheap grove square brand some of which i immediately through away because they shook like a rattle with a dried up chunk of coffee in them the others sound like they have about a teaspoon of dried up indtant coffee grounds in them no comparison to any of the other k cup brands grove square sells for approximately half the price of other k cup brands in retail stores that is because it is instant coffee designed to look like a k cup makes the purchase price of this mix really steep since one third of my k cups were these cheapies i tried them once before and to me they are absolutely undrinkable should note that the product picture and written description does not show or mention grove square as one of the possible brands in the mix i also got teas decafs and about flavored coffees overall a horrible mix that was not worth the price i paid wo not risk it again unless you like the taste of instant coffee or are willing to overpay per cup to get to try some other actual k cup brands in different flavors do not buy this,-1
big disappointment since it tastes like plastic save your money this seasoning does not taste like salt and vinegar wish they offered some type of refund on the unopened bottles,-1

i love the mushrooms and have ordered them in the past but half the cans come in badly dented if only this problem could be fixed i would keep ordering,-1
i was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace the bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route when i opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place i could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so i threw it away i made a mess all over the place what a waste i will not be ordering from this company again,-1
i picked this up from my local health food store i have tried stevia and occationally use it in tea or coffee i think they used way too much of the sweetner it was horrible i wish they just put a lot less of the sugar subsitute it did not taste like what it was supposed to,-1
with the new scare on arsenic levels in rice i did several hours of research and found that different parts of the us that grow rice had different levels of arsenic in the soil which the rice then soaked up i am feeding my month old son brown rice cereal and am very concerned about the arsenic levels i read about i bought this brand and after learning the rice they use is grown in texas and that texas is listed as one of the higher arsenic levels i am returning this product and purchasing bobs red mill organic brown rice farina this rice is grown in california which is listed as the least arsenic levels almost undetectible i tried quinoa and my son did not like it he is a little too young for oatmeal but that will be our next adventure just thought you would all like to know this information good health to everyone,-1
we recently adopted an obese pet and were looking for healthy dog food that could help him lose weight the ingredients seemed great but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements times per day the food did little to help with weight reduction even with all the vomiting and we eventually had to switch to a veterinarian prescribed food instead note our dog does not have a hypothyroid problem after we stopped feeding our dog this brand of dog food his stool has become firmer and less frequent and he is no longer vomiting on a daily basis as i stated above the ingredients seemed very healthy and nutritious but i would not feed this to my dog or recommend it to anyone else,-1
i love loose leaf tea the large leaves brew slowly giving flavor but not bitterness it has a subtle quality about it that sets is apart from the grounds found in tea bags this tea does not have that quality rather than whole leaves the tea is ground up bits like in english breakfast tea even after brewing the leaves are tiny chunks rather than a long slow brew i found that this tea takes on a bitter edge after as little as two and a half minutes i usually brew tea bags longer if you keep the brewing short and use a lot of leaf to compensate it can be drinkable but why bother when you can do better with a bag i will not be buying this again,-1
well they are crunchy except for the seeds that are so hard they do not crunch and maybe they are healthy but i do not find the taste attractive it is not bad for sticks and twigs but i prefer more flavor in this case more salt maybe some garlic to bring out the grain flavors these really remind me of some of the organic snacks in the is you eat them because they are good for you but you would really rather have something else i will stick to beanitos,-1
i bought it for my son when he learned his alphabet at around years old the letters are way too small he did not care for them i bought better ones locally not worth the money i would give it less stars but since it is organic it deserves an extra star,-1
i bought this for my wife to help her nurse i had high hopes for this product but it fell short in several areas first the taste of the tea is awful the fennel seeds are way too overpowering there is a reason that common teas do not include fennel as a flavor enhancer it has an overly strong and odd smell yogi has made no concession to balance out the flavor in fact it tastes like they just put fennel seeds in the tea bags which brings me to my next issue yogi is trying to achieve aqueous extraction with this tea aqueous extraction works well with leaves but does not work well with unground seeds seeds have extra natural protections which will not allow for the best extraction of nutrients using hot water alone this is why coffee beans need to be ground during preparation the fennel fenugreek anise seeds in the tea bags are simply broken up not ground with this product yogi has accomplished the equivalent of putting ungrounded coffee beans in a tea bag and calling it coffee the fennel fenugreek and anise in this product are not leaves they are seeds for it to work in any sort of effective way the seeds would have to be completely ground not just broken besides the poor execution in delivery of the nutrients i was concerned to see that the product had lavender in it which i do not think is all that safe for babies to be even indirectly ingesting i can give yogi credit for acknowledging the wonderful natural properties of fenugreek but i would advise buyers to take it through different means my wife uses,-1
it is definitely coffee with caffeine taste like vanilla mixed with coffee but not as strong as vanilla syrup or anything i honestly do not like this coffee which is personal taste the coffee is well ground and the smell of it brewing is very nice but not the taste of it,-1
sodium phosphate is a preservative so these are not chemical and preservative free that is the part i read but i should have read more carefully i did not realize it was in there when i ordered these for my cats one cat ignores them but my other one loves them but sodium phosphate causes me terrible migraines so i stay away from it in my foods and medicines even a little bit has a bad effect on me this makes me very wary about giving it to my cat the salmon has no marinade and therefore no sodium phosphate so i will get that one again i wish the chicken was more pure i do not do many reviews but i thought i should point this out in case it makes a difference to anyone else i am always looking for healthy food for my cats and dog not sure this is with that chemical in it,-1
perhaps i did not read the description well enough on this item but it is a total disappointment for the price i fully expected it to be in the basket as shown i did not expect it to appear in a booby trap box as soon as i pulled the wrapped box out of the shipping container the bottom of it dropped out there is no basket or even a cardboard tray to contain the items the wrap on the gift box is designed so the lid will not come off ever that being said i was not very excited about the contents either i will not buy this item again nor will i bother with the art of appreciation line of gift baskets this review is for the,-1
this is definitely not my favorite soap i found it to be drying and a bit rough i much prefer and recommend the olive oil soap by kiss my face by the way i heat the soap up a bit in the microwave and cut it into smaller pieces which are easier to use and work better,-1
the item is delivered to a wrong address whoever received this item i hope they would eat them instead of throwing them away i am canceling next order,-1
i received my package of crazy cup sampler to find that i received spice eggnog they tried to get rid of their holiday stock at my expense and i do not appreciate that i also received blueberry coffee cups and did not receive types of coffee i am very dissatisfied my son did a silly youtube video showing the sample that i received i do not recommend this sample pack the sample is packaged in a paper bag that someone throws whatever cups they feel like throwing in the bag do not waste your money,-1

when i received grove square coffee i was at first very happy about the price however it was before i tasted the coffee this is garbage for those of you who appreciate a cup of aroma and flavorful cup of coffee in the morning it would deliver you neither aroma nor flavor it is colored water to say the least exact flavor of diluted bitterly aftertaste instant coffee i would not recommend this product even to my worst enemy,-1
i was expecting the content would be more chunky and higher quality but it is mostly thin slices and gooey dark red matters my two cats do not take too much liking to it so i mix it with the more chunky type of cat food for them with the high price i think the food should come with better quality than this i will not order this again even though the food smells and looks fresher than regular canned cat food,-1
if you care about your health than avoid this way too much sodium and fat,-1
i am surprised that previous reviewers thought highly of the red vine taste my grandkids and i agreed that twizzlers have a much better taste and texture the red vines have a chemical aftertaste i am giving away the remaining packages of red vines,-1
i used this product under the belief that it was really better than regular flour guess what it is not go to the isle on your grocery store and you will see that there is about a carb calorie difference between this and regular wheat flour not to mention this is white refined highly processed taste delicious if you are on atkins or dukans and you eat this you may experience what i experienced my experience is what made me turn around and realize the truth about this insane cravings for more carbs you will want them whether it comes from this product or junk that is because a carb is a carb and regular store bought restaurant style vending machines cafeteria food etc will not use this product you will seriously slip in your will power the serving size for carbquick is only a cup you would do yourself a favor and just spend the money on a regular slice of acne golore i have minimal acne wheat makes me break out atkins gave me the clearest skin ever after a week of this product i had tiny zits all over my face unacceptable considering the expense of this product it is not worth paying for carbquick should be known as the carb that will quickly spike your insulin you would do better to get yourself some almond flour or if you are not wheat sensitive which most people are the fda just does not want to ruin the wheat industry just buy some real flour,-1
i must admit that i did not taste the cookies so they may have been fantastic however i purchased this item for a gift and when it arrived in a plain white pastry box sealed with saran wrap i was disappointed from the start when i peeked inside to see if the cookies were individually wrapped dry crumbs leaked out of the sides from the unwrapped cookies on the interior i will not purchase this product or any other from this seller again,-1
i have two doodles a brother and a sister and the male eats just about everything you put in front of him and many things you do not he seemed very interested in these and even the female took them into her jaws and scurried off alas we found most of them later secreted in different parts of the living room other plato treats have been enthusiastically recieved so i have a good opinion of the company worth a shot but not to the beasties tastes,-1
for the price you can get a much better tasting veggie broth powder seitenbacher vegetable broth rapunzel pure organic veggie broth higher salt content than seitenbacher but you need smaller amounts to acheive similar effect so it all balances out at the end also if you are cooking anything with mushrooms you want to keep the mushroom theme use,-1
i forgot i order them they never came still waiting on them i tried email i got no answer so i gave up on it,-1
this product is not gluten free it has may contain wheat listed right on the top of the box along with in the ingredients list,-1
these chips are really thick they are starchy and a bit dry they taste ok but i will not be tying them again,-1
i purchased this thinking i would get an assortment of several k cups to try i had varieties but with the name sampler pack i assumed there would only be of each kind so i could sample several kinds to decide what i like not just test the same flavor times each packaging was a brown paper bag taped shut and placed in a box with bubble wrap some of the cups are a little dented not impressed overall if i could return it i would and i will not order from this company again,-1
i should say i loved it when i bought it a while ago but never looked so close at it my wife showed me a few very small bugs floating on the water in the rice cooker not going to send them back since i did used some of it and not worth the try hope that it was in a batch of it and the manufacturer can read and figure out this not going to buy it again,-1
the flavor and quality cannot compare to zevia ginger ale made with erythritol and stevia but not into a mega commercial commodity i do not know all of what they must do to process truvia into what it is since they do not have to disclose the process or the additives but no comparison to just good erythritol and stevia would not have thought it would make such a difference we will never buy any of these sodas again all of the zevia sodas are good although more expensive they are worth it and do not make everyone have serious intestinal pain,-1
i have a german shepherd and a american bull mix i decided to switch from taste of the wild dog food to this blue buffalo weight management my american bulldog mix was getting overweight and i wanted to help her shed a few pounds using this food since the totw is pretty high in fat the countless positive reviews on petsmart and mostly good on amazon had me sold i really wish i had tried a different food now i noticed both dogs stool was a little soft when i was gradually changing them over which i did not think much of once i completely switched them over it was probably the first night i was awoken to one of my dogs having terrible diarrhea on my carpet which is a lovely aroma to wake up to she also threw up a couple times that day and the next as well so i took her to the vet and everything was normal the vet gave her some meds just in case it was a stomach bug the next day my shepherd starting having the same terrible diarrhea and went in the house the food is the only thing that has changed with my dogs so i really have no doubt it is what has caused all of the problems i am going to discontinue using this food immediately and probably go back to the totw i would use this food with caution,-1
unfortunately i had the same issue as the previous customer on august i received a product that had expired in june,-1
the dry product is extremely fine almost powdery the cooked product is mushy and does not even taste like grits to me i like the coarse stone ground grits which have not been de germed regular white grits from the grocery store is preferable to this product i will donate the three unopened boxes to our local food bank,-1
i bought this for our christmas dinner big mistake what we received was a very small and extremely overpriced turkey stuffed with little pieces of what may have been duck and or chicken and a lot of nasty tasting stuffing the proportions were nothing like what is pictured unfortunately due to the nature of the product frozen stuffed and the time it is traditionally served thanksgiving and christmas dinner you do not find out it is crap until it comes out of the oven and by then you are stuck with it because most of the stores are already closed despite the small amount of meat it easily fed seven people with ample left overs mainly because nobody finished what was on their plates let alone went back for seconds on a positive note our dog loved the stuff and happily ate everything that was dumped into her bowl,-1
i drink tea everyday and was excited to find such a great deal on this tea regrettably the only good part about this tea was the price the tea tastes somewhat bitter and earthy and not in a good way and is weak also i will not buy this again and will stick to pg tips or yorkshire gold,-1
these cups are not worth the minor convenience they provide the hot chocolate tastes like plastic i can only assume it is a result of hot water hitting the plastic of the cup maybe the coffee ones do not give off this foul taste because of the filter inside i do not know i can not even finish using the cups in the intended way rather i have taken to peeling off the foil dumping the mix into my mug and running a cycle of just water through the keurig nearly as simple without the nasty taste i will not be buying these again i will stick to using the normal packets and running aforementioned cycle of just water do not waste your money,-1
finished half of one steak the other half dropped on my desk so i picked it up saw those nasty white mold on it makes me sick i have seen other reviews saying it had mold issues i did not really take it serious since i loved it now i see the problem not over due not under the sun not in high temperature white mold just found out this today i usually do not write reviews but this is really really i can not think about it anymore just try not to buy it or just buy the ones in at least u can see it u buy it,-1
i was so thrilled with the chebe pizza dough and breads i bought that i had dreams that the chebe cinnamon roll mix would be the same but they did not turn out they where not airy like the other breads and like every other gluten free cinnamon roll i have tried the sugar rolled into the middle just cooks the dough to quick sad,-1
i purchased cartons of instant breakfast through amazon in march they were priced a third of what they are currently too bad it was convenient to order from amazon for this but apparently buy locally is the only option i can afford,-1
if you want true organic pesticide free then you will need to look elsewhere the title and description as of today are deceiving this product is not organic it is only made with some organic ingredients if you read the ingredients the strawberries are not organic however the title and description lead one to believe the product is organic strawberries are at the top of the list of pesticide containing fruits and it is a shame that a company that prints on their cereal boxes since erewhon has led the organic revolution and we remain passionately committed to providing the purest organic foods would cheap out and put non organic strawberries in their cereal if you do not care about eating organic then enjoy the taste is okay i only tried a couple of flakes and they had a slight odd flavor but i cannot comment on the strawberries flavor as i could not bring myself to eat non organic strawberries my husband said the cereal tasted okay but natures path corn flakes and mesa sunrise flakes are much better,-1
not returnable this product is misleading there are only boxes total that comes to for boxes or for a single glass so this is very misleading because this is not package of but of the rice dream packs not only that this item is not returnable that is right i cannot get a refund even if i am not satisfied with the product or something wrong with it i will have to contact the customer service directly and test amazon is service buyers must be careful about buying products from party merchants they do not have the great return policy that amazon does i think that this really degrades my experience with amazon i will be much more weary of buy anything more from amazon in the future especially since it is difficult to distinguish those items sold by amazon and those sold by third party merchants even more important it is difficult to know the return policy on an item until you try to return it updatei emailed amazon and they notified me that this product is indeed sold by amazon and that groceries with expiration dates are not returnable however they refunded my money because the product did not meet my expectations and told me to disposed of it as i wished thanks for the free rice dream amazon hope you change the description on this item as you have done with the other listings of rice dream,-1

unlike the other coconut water products i have purchased this one contains sugar and the container is smaller these two facts must be stated in the description but i had not noticed till i got the order the drink tastes ok if one likes guava,-1
look at the ingredients it is made with black tea google black tea and fluoride and you will see that black tea is loaded with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea fluoride is not healthy for anyone if you want a healthy natural tea get one that is made with white tea leaves white tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much much much less fluoride than either black or green teas,-1

nutri grain bars say in big letters that they use natural ingredients and in small letters that they use chemical dyes and other unnecessary offensive ingredients that cause tongue lesions and other undesirable side effects also there is a tiny kd logo on the package front suggesting that nutri grain is kosher dairy which any person who cares about kosher foods would recognize as an insult at best and a downright fraudulent use of kosher logos at worst,-1
i have been buying dried peaches all the time through sahara my local store has increased the price this year and i started looking on amazon found this one and ordered it took almost a month to arrive and smells terrible i am pretty sure that the manufacturer used sulfur dioxide to process the peaches and left this stinky smell i was in a hurry to travel to eu for a month right after i received the peaches and was not able to file a return do not buy if you care about your health the product description does not include using this chemical for processing i gave one start because i could not give lower,-1
all of the regular drink mixes contain sucralose aka splenda and other artificial sweeteners it gives them an aftertaste i would expect from a diet soda not to mention health concerns and they advertise no high fructose corn syrup like its healthier,-1
i wanted to like it since it is so much healthier than most alternatives but the taste just is not there my daughter and i both immediately said the same thing after tasting it while it is indeed spicy i e hot it is also sweet which sort of deadens the spiciness of the flavor we wish that we had not ordered two boxes of this but had tried a different flavor instead perhaps we will but it is somewhat disconcerting to consider that we might also not like the taste of the different flavor since the cost of the product is not inexpensive thus we are not yet sure that we will order more,-1
we purchased this product to re fill our gumball machine and were generally disappointed by how hard the gum was and how short lived the flavor was compared to other refill products we had purchased in the past although we liked the price at the time in retrospect the purchase did not represent a good value,-1
the box no longer says made with real land o lakes butter and evidently it no longer is the taste is off evidently diamond foods present owner of pop secret general mills would not have made such a foolish decision has no taste for quality this used to be the a premier pop corn now its just a kernel of what it once was,-1

i picked up a jar of this recently at the store to make green curry chicken at home and was very disappointed in the level of spiciness i used a full of the container along with a can of coconut milk and the other ingredients listed on the recipe on the jar fish sauce a little brown sugar etc even with that amount the dish was barely flavorful let alone spicy my husband who really does not much care for spicy food said it was underwhelming so overall it was really disappointing the sauce did turn out smooth and creamy but if it is a good spicy green curry you are after i would try another brand,-1
i tried madagascar vanilla red by celestial which also contains rooibos so i thought i would give this a try due to the great reviews first impression tea is way too sweet and can not wrap my mind around what ingredient causes this sweet taste if you like your tea very sweet and concentrated then this is the one for you after trying both teas hands down madagascar vanilla red is way tastier,-1
these gave me a headache too much sugar and other ingredients that did not sit well i would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier,-1

whether you like this candy or not depends a lot on why you are buying it if you are older like me and looking for the red licorice that was once sold in department store candy counters and candy stores by the bunch in the sixties and seventies then you will be disappointed this is not even remotely similar to that candy until eight years ago our mall candy store sold the original red licorice laces but they replaced it with the kind that tastes like twizzlers in the form of a string i have been looking to no avail for the original variety ever since this order was my last hope and it seems the kind many of us grew up with simply is not being made anymore personally i did not really care for the taste but that means nothing since i was looking for the kind they use to sell and this was not it if anyone does know who sells the original type i wish they would tell me,-1
even though these beans seemed fresh they had terrible flavor they were way worse than the average navy bean from the bulk bins of my local health food stores after cooking one batch i ended up throwing the rest in the garbage i have been frustrated by the uneven quality of beans from my local health food stores sometimes great sometimes terrible often the beans are very old even though the stores i shop from are busy and have high turnover of beans so i have been on a mission to find a mail order source of consistently great beans for navy beans these are not it or at least this batch was not it note i did like eden foods kidney beans so i am not criticizing the brand,-1
this tastes horrible i am fairly sure someone a kikkoman just blended their expired sauces into this horrible concoction this stuff seriously has this odd chemical aftertaste that almost reminds me of curry,-1
i was looking for a new type of mustard other than the standard tastes i have been used to this however was a venture i should not have made it turned out to be the most unpalatable harsh tasting its indescribable the only thing i can assume is its not made for eating directly but to be put in some type of cooking process i washed it down the sink and kept the jar at least got something out the deal,-1
my dog got really sick from eating this product vomiting for days and had to take him to emergency room there have been documented cases of illness and death from chicken jerky products search for articles on this issue i can not believe this has not been recalled i am glad i caught it before he got really sick but there have been many documented cases of death now i do not want to see any more dogs get sick or die from these products,-1
i received this package in the high heat temp and the company did not take any steps to protect the quality of the product i attempted to taste the product even when i was concerned due to how hot the product was upon arrival the almod butter was bad the temp has been around in the st louis area and the company did not request any special shipping to protect the quality of the product the temp with the box in the heat had to be even higher baking in the mailbox i found out after the product arrived in bad shape that a return was not even an option bad business i would never due business this way,-1
throughout the work day i usually drink about ounces of water just sitting at the desk the past couple months i have been trying a variety of different energy drinks and supplements when i had the opportunity to try the vitamin squeeze fruit punch energy drink through amazon is vine program i decided to give it a try i am drinking a lot of water every day anyway so i figured i might as well try to mix things up a little the drink itself comes in a container that looks a little like one of those newer upside down ketchup squeeze bottles there is supposed to be enough product for servings this water additive concoction contains vitamins c as well as magnesium and chromium it is also supposed to contain of caffeine about the same as a can of regular soda i liked the overall design of the bottle it is aesthetically pleasing and the bottle is quite easy to use once it is opened it also does seem to provide a very short burst of energy after use however i had several issues with the product the first issue i had with vitamin squeeze fruit punch energy drink is that it is a bit more difficult to open in addition to removing the wrapping from around the edge you have to poke open the squeeze hole i tried just squeezing but it did not work so i ended up using an ice pick you can probably use the tip of a knife or a prong of a fork too beyond using a measuring cup there is no real way to figure out exactly how much of a squeeze is required for an bottle of water or a water bottle so the user is left to guestimate it took about a of the bottle over several days before i was able to get close to what i think was the proper amount the biggest issue i had with this energy drink was the flavor personally i think it tastes horrible it is supposed to be a fruit punch flavored additive however it tastes more like liquid sweet tarts it has a very strong acidic aftertaste that completely eradicates the initial sweetness that one tastes after i got down to less than a bottle i tried drinking the vitamin squeeze directly from the bottle i thought it might help with the flavor i was completely wrong the horrible sweet tart taste just became even more pungent so though vitamin squeeze fruit punch energy drink does seem to provide a short burst of energy and has lots of vitamins the positives are almost wiped out by the horrible taste personally i would take a energy drink or a can of no fear over this energy drink,-1
original review i must be a freak because i really like this granola and can not stand some of the other gluten free granolas that get much better ratings here on amazon i do not know why i like it but even though the berry flavor tastes a bit artificial i like its tangy semi sweetness a lot better than the awful maple and apple cinnamon ones that i have tried i think those taste even more fake and much too sweet i guess i am not a fan of eating a lot of sugar on my cereal and this one tastes less sweet than some of the others i guess it is really a matter of personal taste i am going against the crowd on this one i just ordered a have to change my review i ordered six of these but what i received is not the same product that i have been buying in my local grocery store either they have changed it to make it worse or amazon is selling old stock and the one in the grocery store is the improved version plus i got heartburn big time from this one and never had it before from the grocery store item i did not like it at all am donating the remaining packages to a homeless shelter or a gluten intolerant friend two stars now,-1
bought these for my god daughters birthday party the lollipops are cute but they lacked taste some of the children licked them and then tossed them,-1
hi frustrated with amazon and arrowhead mills have only recieved box becareful i am working on getting an exchange amazon will not refund my return arrowhead mills is not interested in helping because they are not the orginal supplier two years ago i received moldy bread from amazon and ener g took care of me what a difference my last order from amason of arrowhead mils products was wrong too they sent me whole wheat cookie mix instead of gluten free hmmm someone is dropping the ball for arrowhead mills,-1
while this soup tasted pretty good i just can not get over all the chunks of shell in almost every bite it really made this an unpleasant experience to eat i do not know if this is normal for this product or if this was just a bad batch but i was picking bits of shell out of my mouth with almost every bite not a fun experience,-1
i have a scottie and apparently his weight was what saved him interestingly my dog would not take the treat the second time i offered him one thank heaven within hours of giving him this product he started throwing up and the treat came up almost intact because it had not digested i took him into the vet when he started crying and was listless the vet said if jamie had been a smaller dog the treat could have killed him so i am out for my vet and associated medicine i am stunned amazon would even handle this product,-1
this is the worst chili i have ever had used can and took the rest back to costco for refund i have never returned food products to costco for this reason,-1
i never received my cookies it says they have been delivered but when i contacted the company to tell them ive never got them they told me to contact the post office who said they did not have them the company did nothing about this matter not very good customer service at all,-1
wow i had one yesterday and all afternoon and night i was filled with gas i could not figure out what i ate that caused this but i loved them so much that i was looking on line for a place to order a big box i am so happy that i came across the reviews on amazon otherwise i would have ordered more boxes and had to get rid of them one thing i do know is that if your body is not used to a lot of fiber that it can upset your stomach what you may want to do it gradually introduce it into your diet i e start with a third of one and see if that bothers you if it does then its not the fiber its something else in the bar this is what i am going to try because i really like them thanks for all of the reviews because i am not sure i would have figured it out there is a blog on the internet about these bars complaining about the same thing they actually wrote to the company and received a response back that they all had a good laugh for the day the blogger said that there is chicory root in the bars and that can cause gi problems i will have to look at the ingredient list myself then look up the chicory root if its not that then its the fiber which means you have to gradually get your body used to it,-1
i love amazon and i love these bars but ordering off of the internet is not the way to go on these and i should have listened to the other reviews in this case you get what you pay for i but these religiously at multiple stores locally and they are always soft and fresh as other reviewers mentioned ordering from amazon they come in hard as rocks inedible and when i went to return them they say you cant i will be contacting my cc company as i paid some dollars for stale food will not be ordering these again very disappointed,-1
i have two cats one is a ragdoll and one is a rescue both of them like the gravies in canned cat food but they will not even go near this product turn up their noses and high tail it the other way can not even get them near it tried both containers i ordered thinking it might just be the first one i opened nope they will not even touch it wasted my money on this purchase,-1
this was so not worth the buy i think they had a horrible after taste and just did not like them at all,-1
this cereal is awful after i eat one bowle then i feel like throwing it up it is discusting and i would never buy it again it tastes good but the feelings after eating it is gross it feels like you ate hamburgers i like the taste but after the after taste is gross,-1
i love coconut but this coffee tastes like tanning lotion i could not even finish my cup of coffee which is very rare two thumbs down,-1
this drink is not one of the best i have used the taste is medicinal i have better results energy and calorie burning wise with celcius and vpx drinks the celcius available for really great value at costco and the vpx among many others at amazon or vitamin shop blue sky enters this market with a poor tasting product and hopes to overcome it is shortfall by claiming it is all natural too bad,-1
i was so excited to see the crusty looking french bread on the front of the box i bought it and went home to make it immediately however i was very disappointed because the texture is more like buscuits than the bread on the cover and it looks nothing like the cover in texture either i will not be buying this again because i have a better biscuit recipe no need to spend the money and not get the expected result,-1
rather than a sampler of different coffee types this appears to be a way to get rid of damaged or outdated goods and get paid for it there was not even a good sampling as i had three each of several blends and not one of each as i would expect from a sampler just about all of the individual k cups were damaged in one way or another as well,-1
hate the taste no fineness of taste not only this brand but most of s korean food contains too much salt and red pepper which increase the risk of stomach cancer it is known that very small amount of red pepper can protect stomach but too much damages stomach so much,-1
great chocolate but these are available for in any decent supermarket paying per oz plus shipping is simply foolish,-1
i can not believe how bad this stuff was i opened the noodle package and it smelled stale and awful the dehydrated vegetables did not hydrate in the microwave time i even added more time and so i was crunching on them while trying to eat the noodles it was not a good crunch the saving grace was the szechuan sauce which was good but not good enough to cover the bad i would rather have cup noodles than this stuff,-1
i have been a customer of right foods for almost years but the asian entrees do not do it for me they taste bitter and the seasoning is inconsistent,-1
do not be fooled by the label great tasting when mixed this stuff tastes terrible if you want something better tasting muscle milk is the way to go,-1
product did not work i have worked with starter for years i decided to buy something new i followed all of the directions exactly as days later nothing,-1
do not waste your time the beef sticks are not good the flavor is fake and nothing like a real beef stick the texture will almost make you gag you do not even need to chew these beef sticks there is a reason why you can get this amount of volume at the price not worth it,-1
i ordered this item and the next day i tried to cancel it as i found it cheaper in the store they had not processed my order yet but they did not let me cancel anything when i received the product the expiration date was close by ordered it in end march and it will expire in june how the heck do you use packs of peanut butter in months i am truly disappointed in this seller,-1
this stuff is awful i have purchased many far better chinese teas over the years after or cups i gave the rest away i received this from amazon in mid march but there is no date anywhere so perhaps decades old,-1
these things are nothing like oreos you think wow oreos think again i would say spend your money on something better the hershey is or reese is crisp wafer bars come to mind my honest view on these thin crisps cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer or milk bones,-1
worst excuse for mocha java we have ever experienced in the past years mary and i could not have been more disapointed we are not coffee snobs we just love mocha java and this is not it for us,-1
first this product package is about the size of a cool aid package approximately x it comes in a sealing foil package similar to cool aid i ordered this through the vine program and to my amazement this small package of powdered drink mix came in a box big enough for books it came in a x box stuffed full of protective air bubbles while i appreciate good packaging the waste here completely turned me off it was incredible the product itself was so so not terrible but not really good either it is definitely not something that i would replace my green tea or peppermint tea with during the day so i do not see myself drinking it or desiring it if you something a bit different you may want to give it a try but i was not very impressed with either the taste or the waste associated with this product and will not be using it again,-1
let me start by saying this is not a bad tasting oatmeal if the description said it was regular oatmeal with flaxseed i would give it stars however calling this product flaxseed cinnamon and blueberry flavored is outright false and misleading i might have spotted blueberry in my bowl after emptying packets there is not even any blueberry flavor to this oatmeal or cinnamon flavor either,-1
i picked this up at the grocery store thinking oh this will make for a quick and cheap meal that is was as i ate it i thought to myself this is pretty tasty considering it came right from the box as the night went on my stomach started to get very upset it made me feel absolutely miserable stomach in knots cramping bloating gas diahrrea you know the works consider this a fair warning for anyone considering trying this product,-1
be cautioned do not order these in the summer no protection was taken to protect these from the summer heat so i received a lb bag of gummy goo the entire bag was liquid when i received it,-1
this is supposed to be tender popcorn and it is anything but that and the seller will not respond to my emails requesting a refund i am very sorry i ordered this product,-1
i found this product online after deciding that keeping in business single handedly with my pumpkin latte addiction was not the best choice for my wallet i would read online that this is the same mix that uses but it is a lie this mix has much more spice in it or maybe i just got a bad batch and since i am technically allergic to cinnamon i can not really enjoy this i am bummed out because now i have i bunch of unopened tins of the stuff i am thinking of making care packages just to give them away,-1
i drink a lot of crystal light and generally enjoy the fruity flavors the crystal light mocktails mojito mix does not bring me enjoyment this mojito mix is disgusting and after drinking a single half glass i am dumping the entire pitcher and throwing out the rest of the package yes it is that bad the synthetic mint flavor hits hard and continues to punish long after you have swallowed yuck yuck yuck my wife was not quite as offended but she agreed that it was not good and had no issue with me discarding the product,-1
i bought this thinking it would be good for my month old since he loves variety unfortunately i only got to let him try a few of them there was no packaging in the box and several jars broke there was food and glass all over the box and amazon will not let you return food items i did get a partial refund though but alas he likes the gerber food better,-1
i absolutely loved this product at first i had one of the first models and it worked wonderfully until one day it simply would not turn on i called the company and they sent me a new model the steam chamber of the new model smells horrible i can not quite pinpoint the smell but it is somewhere between metallic and burnt plastic all the food i have steamed also has this metallic taste to it i have done the cleaning with distilled vinegar and distilled water twice already but the food still tastes metallic this freaks me out because i have no idea what is being deposited on the food obviously i will not be giving any steamed food to my baby i have called customer service again and i am waiting for a call back,-1
i was gullible enough to believe that these bags would be something other than oz each at a price of ea for what i would consider a cent convenience store item no wonderthey do not tell what the size of the bag is,-1
i would be the first to applaud these products if they were good unfortunately i would rather give up drinking that have to drink this tasteless slop there is a very nasty artificial acrid too citrusy while at the same time too sweet taste to these products the strawberry margherita mix has a very faint taste of strawberry but no amount of doctoring could make it drinkable i poured the mix out the mai tai mix poured it out i bought several bottle dry drink mixes of all their varieties without trying them first big mistake i am either going to pour them out or throw them out since the folks at baja bob is web site have refused to even respond to my request that i return the unopened products for a refund you will also note that on their web site is fan club page there are entries save your money unless you are totally desperate you would be better off using crystal light ruby red grapefruit now that tastes pretty good mixed with vodka,-1
one of the packages has already melted when i receive it another one is ok really upset about this,-1
could not use this because it is full of msg which i am allergic to as are some of my friends you should list ingredients on items like this,-1
i tried this for my month old who had a bad reaction apparently to the raspberries as he had been introduced to pears prior to that my pediatrician chastised me and said that berries of any kind should not be introducted to infants until they are at least a year old we love earth is best baby foods but now i know to do extra research and not assume that just because the label says months and up does not make it okay,-1
at least it was chicken stuffing flavored i expected chicken stuffing mix a whole ounce container what arrived was nasty tasting hormel chicken n stuffing prepared microwave meals of them in case box at ounces each i have to say there was a large chunk of all white meat chicken in the middle of the disgusting mess though,-1
these are not black winter truffles tuber melanosporum i thought the price was too good to be true even though they are not fresh and it is these are tuber indicums it says so right on the label i was very angry about this but jr mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them so i give jr credit for excellent responsiveness and customer service although i still feel they should not be labeled black winter truffles,-1
tastes funny it was not labeled from china on the info page when i bought it i will not eat this product will not give it away can t return it only thing left to do is throw it away will not purchase any food from china my health is more important,-1
i tasted this product and all i can say is yecch i am normally the type who loves a cold cappuccino drink whether i get it from the store or at one of the local coffee shops but illy issimo is cappuccino coffee drink had a bitter metallic taste that i have never experienced in other store bought cappuccinos it might be just me but i would strongly suggest that in the future the makers of this drink rework the mixture and find some way to treat the cans so that this product does not come out with a metallic bitter flavor such as what i experienced when i drank it,-1
in proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content but i would prefer a regular soda than this stuff there is a slight citrus taste but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing pleasant and nice refreshment but none of these traits are in this drink i would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone i liked for any occasion but would consider giving it to people i really did not care for to see their reaction avoid this one orange crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame,-1
i had to add more cheddar to get a real natural flavor and texture annie is loses to safeway is organics according to my wife even though it has a carroty fake cheddar color,-1
i will not be purchasing this product again taste is great but there are many unpopped kernels in the bag i am now awaiting an appointment with my dentist to get my tooth fixed after biting into one of these unpopped kernels taste is not worth the pain of a broken tooth,-1
maybe it was just the blend that i got but this english tea had an off taste and aroma no matter how dilute i prepared it it was stagnant every time and i have english tea in the past in order to not waste it i mix it with herbs hibiscus and or mint at a very small ratio haha,-1
this is the most bland boring sauce i have had the misfortune to encounter it is not the salt though certainly that is a piece of the puzzle but the sauce itself tastes very watered down and with just a hint of any spice and the only spice to taste is a little bit of pepper that is it it distinctly lacks in any sort of flavor indian flood is very flavorful usually so that pretty much makes this one a pass completely do not bother find a good indian recipe on the net and make your own or find a good indian buffet,-1
i ordered three of these dinosaur nylabones i only opened one and none of my dogs is interested in it it is coarse and has no odor to enhance its use to the chewers it is intended for and i am out a pile of money,-1
first i have to say that i love yogi tea i love the messages on the tea bags and some flavors are remarkable this one however is horrible i guess if you love licorice root you will like it but i do not i tolerate the licorice flavor in the calm yogi tea because it really calms me before bed and makes me feel like i am floating on a cloud but it still manages to taste good whereas this one does not please do buy yogi tea and get the green tea slim life instead terrific taste which tastes like green tea with berries in it a good flavor and not an artificial flavor to it this fasting tea has a bitter after taste which is all licorice root stay clear of this flavor but do buy yogi tea i feel transformed by the messages on the tea bags as it is so profound wise quotes from yogi tea by yogi bhajan the universe is the stage on which you dance guided by your heart the purpose of life is to enjoy every moment delight the world with compassion kindness and grace laugh because that is your purpose in life happiness is every human beings birthright be happy so long as breath is in you real happiness lies in that which never comes nor goes but simply is travel light live light spread the light be the light practice kindness mercy and forgiveness bliss cannot be disturbed by gain or loss compassion has no limit kindness has no enemy there is no love without compassion appreciate yourself and honor your soul love your soul grace brings trust appreciation love and compassion be proud of who you are there is nothing more precious than the self love is where compassion prevails and kindness rules an attitude of gratitude brings opportunities recognize that the other is you life is a flow of love your participation is requested where there is love there is no question your greatest strength is love the best way to live is to be simply be when you know that all is light you are enlightened your head must bow to your heart your greatness is not what you have it is what you give fall in love stay in love and it will decide everything all that is needed is surrender and gratitude to be calm is the highest achievement of the self may this day bring you peace tranquility and harmony old age needs wisdom and grace understanding is found through compassion love compassion and kindness are anchors in life inspiring others towards happiness brings you happiness,-1
all of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great truth is i am disappointed the popcorn kernels are tough chewy and lack any great corn taste i want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it i will go back to buying the premium orville redenbacher is brand at my local grocery,-1
bought this recently and will not purchase again for someone who likes strong coffe this did not do it for me,-1
my dogs sniffed these chews and then left them ignored on the floor for the next week finally i picked them up and since they had not been chewed i figured i would pass the bag to a friend rather than waste them since my dogs would not chew them i cannot recommend them my dogs are not very fussy with chews i am unsure why they lack appeal for my dogs but having them lay on the floor so long there is definitely a lack of flavor or scent they are not inexpensive either i am sorry that my dogs could not give them a second chance,-1
i ordered this product and only received one box of the back to nature white cheddar spirals dinner instead of boxes amazon com did charge me for the entire case though they tried another time to send me the correct package but again i only got one box they told me i could keep the two boxes for my troubles and they would cancel my order however a month later they charged my credit card for the two boxes i had to call and have them take the charge off this product was more trouble than it was worth,-1
first if i could have rated this zero stars i would havi would like to say i am a regular eater of protein bars this is nothing like that rather a cut down version of a crunchy candy bar it is extremely small it did not even fill the modest size package that is was wrapped in approx of the size of a usual bar it is thin as well as short extremely sweet and modest crunch it might only measure calories but most of those come from simple sugar the first ingredients are sugar so if you want a sugar high fine but if your are looking for a healthy low cal mid meal snack that is healthy find another bar there are loads of them out there so inconclusion this is a cut down candy bar faking it as a healthy low calorie item kellogg you can do way better than this,-1
i enjoy the nutty flavored coffees and figured with all the positive reviews i would enjoy this the aroma is very appealing but the taste is both weak and stale not sure if i got a bad batch but i struggle to give it if i could drink the smell it would be a,-1
like a fool i ordered a box instead of a bag to try they are disgusting they smell like dead fish i rinsed and rinsed still smelled in the right light they even look neon purple crack me up i can not believe i was so stupid to buy these,-1
the bars taste very gingery and are unnecessarily way too sweet at least for me i bought them because of the coffee and chocolate content but could only taste ginger will have to throw them away as my husband will not eat them eather,-1
i ordered the maxwell house morning blend for tassimo medium in the larger cup size oz to compare with the gevalia morning roast both are described as medium strength but the maxwell house arrived labeled as mild and the coffee is indeed mild tasting versus the gevalia is medium,-1
i love coconut juice and thought wow it will be so much cheaper this way nope because you are not going to drink it it tastes awful chalky no coconut flavor and warm as opposed to real coconut juice refrigerated at the same temperature is really cold do not buy this it is a good idea that it seems they did not try themselves before going full scale gross,-1
they have changed this recipe and it does not taste the same anymore the last time i order it was a little different but i could still drink it now it is not the same at all and i am so disappointed it is not even drinkable i am going to contact the company to see if they can do anything,-1
these coffee pods come up when you search for jamaica me crazy k cups so yeah i was in a hurry and ordered these by mistake guess what they are not returnable thanks a lot amazon you are no longer a source of k cups for me,-1
ghirardelli had been my standby for xmas candy making since it was the only brand left i could find in my town that made actual white chocolate chips but this year they like everyone else seem to think that no one will notice the difference if they take out the actual y know chocolate part believe me manufacturers we can tell the difference so this year since i could not find any white chocolate chips i just went with the nestle is since if ghirardelli is making the same inferior product i might as well go with the cheaper option right well i should have just given up on using white coatings on anything because this stuff is utter crap i actually do not think it tastes all that bad it tastes like the coating on a zero bar basically but if i am making homemade candy it is not supposed to taste like a cheap commercial candy bar it is supposed to taste like good quality homemade candy more important than this though is the fact that they did not even melt and i could not use them i followed the directions precisely but i kept stirring and heating in tiny increments and they just would not melt and then finally i guess they seized or something because i was left with an unusable lump of half melted weirdly hardened white chips i never ever had this problem with actual white chocolate before and i have been using it for years and years this was a complete waste of my money ugh give us back our actual white chocolate candy manufacturers we do know the difference we will pay a little more for the real thing if you would just give us the option of doing so,-1
mostly water and not a chunk to be found this is shameful about enough tuna mush in a can to make one small sandwich as i understand it sams club guarantees satisfaction for this product the remainder is going back next trip,-1
i love hot chocolate so when my wife got a keurig i had to try the hot chocolate boy was it awful the chocolate taste was so weak i had to add a good scoop of swiss miss to make it drinkable there was also a taste of plastic i think the k cup gets so hot it actually melts the cup a little,-1
okay i think this is a great idea super concentrated drink liquidin a nice tiny bottle that you can customize the stregnth by how much you add to the water the main gripe i have is with the taste way to fakey in my opinion does nt taste exactly like brewed sweet tea to my taste buds it is not horrible just no the greatest either i guess i do got to remember this is a concentrate and not the real thing i love real tea iced sweet and hot so i guess i will be sticking with my good ol tea bags some will like this stuff i for one did nt care that much for it,-1
granola was very dry and not too sweet need milk i prefer costco is granola it taste much better i would not recommend the purchase of this product now i got to find way to get rid of the other packages also bought the fruit and nut one hope that is better,-1
original review off i love and use regularly other madhava products both light and dark regular agave syrups as well as coconut sugar i eat almost entirely organic foods and really needed a more affordable hazelnut flavoring for my coffee currently i am using flavorganics hazelnut which is exaclty the flavor i love but i was looking for something a little more affordable the taste is just off and it is not the agave i love both light and dark agave from madhava it has a chemical or artificial taste to it and i could not do more than two sips of coffee to tell i needed to get rid of the entire i am going to see if amazon will take them back even if i have to pay shipping because i think it is offensively bad the flavorganics has actual organic hazelnut extractives which taste like real hazelnuts like the ones in justin is hazelnut nut butter updated review notified amazon that i was extremely displeased with the quality of this product even though it is clearly not the fault of amazon nor their responsibility to ensure i am happy they went out of their way to make me an even happier customer than i normally am i mean we spend hundreds of dollars a month on amazon easily and i think it is one of the best companies in the world if we can not find it on amazon or at trader joe is then we probably do not need it i still think this product is terrible and i have always thought that the starred reviews should reflect only the quality of the product for better or worse however i figure the words of the review can stray from that requirement,-1
seeing such great deals here for green mountain coffees i assumed they would have the best deal on my dark magic blend i love most of the come in packs with in a pack but the dark magic is clearly the exception it is way over priced here i can get an pack in target for but low and behold over at coffee cow a pack is much better deal,-1
the peas are not green like the photo on the package they do not taste like peas and the coating does not taste like wasabi all in all these are a failure,-1
when this quinoa arrived i was so excited it was so large and light weight and the seller was so nice following up to ensure that it had arrived safely unfortunately i did not get around to using it right away first use it was super gritty despite rinsing like eating sand so the second time around i soaked it for minutes again gritty the and final time i soaked it an hour still gritty and mushy the remaining uncooked quinoa has been thrown away this is no reflection of the seller they were very thorough,-1
first of all let me be clear that i really like this product it is yummy and the price is good the reason for the one star rating is that i have been reordering it for quite a while i reorder from my shopping list so i do not read the description carefully since i am just re ordering exactly the same thing i have gotten before or so i thought this time the bottles were half the size but the price was the same i looked at an old bottle actually can and noted that it was oz this time the three cans were each oz now the description clearly says oz so i can not complain about that but it came off my shopping list which always before sent me three oz cans so bottom line is just be careful if you have ordered this in the past and be aware of what you are getting it is still a good value just not a killer deal as it was before,-1
i really really really wanted to like this i like other things from this company and i love coconut water especially straight outta the nut no sweeteners needed i also like coconut manna and coconut smell and coconut milk shredded coconut etc this tastes nothing like coconut water i think the stuff they add to it is what ruins it it tastes salty and fake i wish they could would just dehydrate the coconut and powder it and package that maybe it would be different i love coconut water but do not feel comfortable with the environmental cost of shipping etc i was happy to find it in powdered form and happy that there were so few ingredients i really wanted to like this i am so bummed i can not even give it away i see it is out of stock maybe they are reformulating it big tree farms if you read this please improve the taste of your formulation and let us know when you have i will gladly update my review for an improved product i rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions i hope this review helped you too,-1
this product is way too sweet i diluted with half milk and there are still chunks of sugar and it is syrupy sweet even my husband who enjoys spoonfuls of maple syrup thinks it is too sweet,-1
box is bent and all of the sticks are stuck together this is gift i will not be giving this the way it is please let me know if there is anything i can do,-1
i should have read the prior reviews because they captured my opinion exaactly the gooy stuff inside one of the candies from a few years ago could supply a days production run today,-1
recently i ended up trying out the senseo system and i tried it with the douwe egberts medium roast pods normally i drink cold brewed toddy coffee and even though i am sensitive to bitterness and acid levels in coffee i can drink that with just dairy no sugar i immediately needed quite a bit of sugar for this coffee and then i had to start drinking half my usual amount of coffee it was so bitter i almost could not drink it it was so acidic it made my stomach hurt and it was so caffeinated i got the shakes that first time the problem was i had no idea if this was a result of the senseo process the toddy is cold brew method does result in a less bitter less acidic less caffeinated coffee than normal or the coffee brand so i ordered the ecopad refillable pods to a pack very inexpensive and tried it with the same coffee i use with the toddy it tasted slightly weak oddly however it was enough for me to realize that the main problem was the douwe egberts coffee if you really love the harsher starbucks types of coffees which i do not i think you will enjoy it but if you have acid stomach problems or just do not like bitter coffee i do not recommend using de medium roast coffee pods with your senseo,-1
previously made in europe later the usa but now made in china the taste and smell are not what it used to be,-1
my year old loves the squeeze applesauce so i was looking for a healthier alternative she loves the plum baby blends but this one she would not eat it has a grainy texture and bland taste,-1
just received this item i was shocked at how tiny it was the size should be described as mini in fact they should state the dimensions in the product description the small size is long the gnawhides are thick wide have a week old cairn weighs lbs that is a very active chewer he would probably try to swallow this thing whole it would take him longer to chew his dog food than it would one of the rawhide rings i know dog toys are not cheap if you are buying them all the time but the price for this size bone is ridiculous to me especially when you add to that the cost of the refills this toy would have been great for my pom when she was a baby she weighed lbs at months but for a small dog guess my idea of small is way different rated this item stars only because it arrived quickly,-1
i had high hopes for this cool brew coffee yes it is low in acid and very smooth however the mocha flavor was almost non existent and i had to add sugar to make it sweet so the easy cup of iced mocha coffee i was hoping for was not so easy once i had to add chocolateand sugar i would return it but the shipping was more than the cool brew so i am stuck withit,-1
i absolutely hate the taste of this tea but if it would work i would get it again could not find it anywhere else but i think it is too expensive,-1
was basically just instant coffee and very sweet i was hoping for one more like the tassimo cappuccino pods but no such luck will def not buy again,-1
these are total crap did not catch one fly followed directions to the letter no results complete rip off beware,-1
spanish olives are not as perfumed as italian also wait for sales and you do better,-1
nylabone healthy edibles puppy chews turkey and sweet potato petite pouchthis product has given my puppies diarrhea avoid it,-1
just open the package and start huffing the fumes alone will get you going seriously these have the same acrid chemical bite as a dry erase marker phew if you are brave enough or stupid enough after that smell to eat a stick get your trash can ready this stuff is nasty like seriously seriously nasty with a hint of green apple it is like chewing on a green apple stick made of gasoline yuck i am not picky about my gum i am really not but i wound up spitting this out when i dared a green apple loving co worker to eat one he bit half of it off chewed it for a few seconds then said okay i am done and spit it out i suggested we keep it around for interviewees it would be a great test of character and we could evaluate how our candidate handles the pressure of being offered a piece of gum and then discovering it was poisonous but it did not fly anyway stay far far away from this one,-1
after trying,-1
i ordered the k cup assortment that was supposed to have different flavors to sample instead i received different ones and the rest were doubles two of the same i wanted to sample different flavors i only have different samples since some of them are doubled,-1
ok first lets start with the packaging forget about actually being able to pull the two sides apart at the top of the bag to get it open and just get the sissors out of the misc drawer and cut the top off then of course it does not seal very well by rolling the bag down and bending the ends of the wire over that is stuck to the bag there is no way to get anything even close to a seal so before opening try to find something to put the coffee in after you get the bag open i used an empty ovaltine jar the ovaltine would have made better coffee than this does when i opened the bag of coffee it had a distinct burnt smell to it with just a faint hint of vanilla hiding in it it smelled the same as it was brewing in my drip coffee maker from other flavored coffee is that i have tried i have got used to cutting it scoops of flavored coffee to one of folgers this time i used some of the french roast folgers which was a waist of a scoop of good folgers coffee the directions on the bag says to use two level teaspoons of it for every oz of cold fresh water i cant even imagine trying to drink a cup as strong as it would be brewed to those directions i have tried this coffee with just a little sugar the way that i usually like my coffee and it was not drinkable i tried it with a little chocolate flavored creamer then a lot of sugar and a lot of chocolate flavored creamer and it still was not drinkable i would really like to have a nice cup of vanilla flavored coffee but i am not going to get one from this no matter what i have tried with it it still tastes burnt i even tried it with some french vanilla flavored creamer and it still tastes burnt i would really like to be able to say something positive about this coffee but i cant i tried to brew a pot in my new bunn hg phase brew home brewer even the bunn coffee maker could not get a decent tasting cup of coffee from this and it makes the best coffee i have ever had maybe this bag came from a bad batch that got burnt by being roasted too long maybe what ever puts the vanilla flavoring in it was almost out and it did not get enough or as much as it was supposed to get from all the other positive reviews i must have got a bad bag or maybe its because i was a heavy smoker for over yrs before i quit smoking yrs ago and i still have damaged taste buds something was causing this to produce undrinkable coffee and if it was not the coffee then it has to be something else making it taste bad unless you like coffee that tastes burnt do not waist your money on this,-1
if you want pumpking flavored coffee buy the timothys perfectly pumpkin coffee instead i bought it at kohls a couple weeks ago with a off coupon i had and some kohls cash and glad i did not waste a lot of money on it green mountain coffees are usually good and i loved the timothys pumpkin i got last year so decided to try this and was disappointed like others have said it is weak and taste nothing like pumpkin the flavor is not bad if you want a weaker nutmeg cinnamon flavored coffee but it tastes nothing like pumpkin,-1
i had this tree sent to my daughter for her birthday but it arrived in poor condition and only got worse we fared no better with a second attempt we were very disappointed to say the least but amazon was very cooperative about our return,-1
switch is a lightly carbonated beverage that claims of what you want of what you do not unfortunately i count calories and i do not want calories for something that tastes like a slightly fizzy apple juice drink the flavor was supposed to be black cherry but it tasted strongly of apple juice which makes sense since it is one of its main ingredients i simply do not see myself switch ing to this drink rather than my diet black cherry or diet cherry cola soda if i want to drink a vitamin drink then i turn to emergen c which is much lower in calories and packs a huge vitamin wallop it also adds a carbonated feel to juice products when i choose one of those so unlike the advertising i did not find switch to be the perfect balance between juice and carbonation,-1
though the product description makes this sound like a healthy snack one look at the ingredient list tells otherwise full of artificial flavoring dyes corn syrups and a myriad of things i can not pronounce this is not what i will reach for when i want a healthy snack on the upside there are only calories per bar and while i refused to taste it my taste tester at home proclaimed it to be really good crisp and chewy at the same time good perhaps for those not concerned about ingredients and only calories but not for my lifestyle,-1
this product was definately a waste my money it certainly did not taste like butter and had no buttery taste to it which is what the claim is i guess that is why they have the six pack purchase because they know this stuff isn is worth it also feel that they are trying to get rid of this stuff if i could return this it would certainly be in the mail by now for a refund terrible buttery popcorn topping if you have taste buds you will be dissappointed,-1
i thought these were the same as i purchased at christmas time from costco i purchased these for valentine is day and they are just awful they taste like cocoa covered lard do not care what the price is i would rather have a delicious taste like the ones from costco they do not have them anymore i do not know how anybody can say these taste delicious they have no taste at all,-1
i opened up the package it smelled really bad the kids would not even taste them so i decided to give one a try it was just wrong got to looking and found mold growing on some of the medallions i could not find an expiration date on the package but i am guessing it was some time during wwii i thought the whole point of beef jerky was to preserve the beef i am going to try to post a picture to the item page i contacted customer service and they are sending out a replacement hopefully it will be less fuzzy tried the teriyaki flavor and they are ok nothing to write home about though,-1
i really love the gummi raspberry candies these are not particularly soft or fresh tasting and the candy non pareils the little beady candies are a bit too large perhaps other haribo candies are better but i can not enthusiastically recommend these,-1
although not exactly as i remember raisin bread it is a welcome treat after so long without it has a good texture toasts well but could have more cinnamon flavor it is somewhat pricey but i miss bread so i splurge a little update i need to warn consumers that although this packaging should last until the expiration date you must examine this bread before you use it at you can not eat this bread too fast even though it is light as i got to the last three loaves i noticed mold on most of the slices i hoped none was tainted that was already eaten it was well before the expiration date i now have too much of a distrust of this product to order it again the ener g company took the bad bread back and will send me replacement loaves they asked why i did not order from them from now on i think i will it can not be any more expensive this price is no bargain,-1
the shipping was fast and the customer service was excellent i was just very disappointed in the product itself the product claims to give energy and reduce appetite yet after drinking the tea i never experienced a decrease in appetite or any energy would not buy it again,-1
received product in a timely manner but it had a best by date of that is almost a year past not happy with it at all,-1
i had high hopes of this food after seeing the ingredients and reading the reviews but my cats will not touch the stuff it has a very thin slop like texture whole peas and is a pale grayish brown color the only way they will eat it is if i mix it with other food and even then they turn their noses up at it most of the time i should have bought one can at the pet store before committing to on amazon next time i will be smarter,-1
okay i have tried several of this company is products and they are fair however this one was shockingly bad the flavor was not just bland it was repulsive it was disturbing to imagine this is something people actually enjoy i have given up on it i have decided to not eat the other cans i cannot in good faith give it to others,-1
i grew up on kraft mac n cheese in the blue box and still love it my kids love it too when i picked up a box of deluxe i had only the highest expectations it starts out the same cooking the dried noodles in boiling salted water then you add the packet of cheese sauce and things go downhill from there first of all the cheese is like the kind you get from the convenience store for your nachos and not the good ones either it seems like hot liquid plastic that glows orange the taste is somewhat bitter artificial and chemical like my kids took one bite and said eew i thought they were overreacting because how bad could something i have enjoyed in the blue box be especially the deluxe version in the end we ended up throwing the whole batch out still love the original but will not be buying the deluxe again,-1
i thought this would be wonderful because i love nuttela let me tell you this is a terrible product i have never had a nut butter that was so bad even the natural peanutbutter i tried was not this bad first let me say if your looking for a nuttela like product buy nuttela this product tastes like they took peanut shells added water oil and a pinch of poor quality chocolate put it in a blender and pulsed it twice the texture is gritty at best i swear they used shells not nuts horrible thew it away immediately,-1
anyone who says this tastes like choc milk or yoo hoo is nuts i had it over ice and could hardly get it down i wanted to like it and am extremely disappointed that it is so bad tasting delivery was not what i expected either it came in a box with many other items it was way too heavy and the box was ripped to shreds i think the ups guy carried it to my door like a basket and everything fell out i guess the good news is it came quickly along with the disappointment,-1
in full honesty i thought i had order one pound of sanding sugar at the same price and was a little confused when i opened the box since i really did not need a pound i decided to keep this product i agree with the other review that rated these expensive for what they are just slightly colored sugar i sprinkled them on my daughter is birthday cake and she liked them a few minutes at the most later when we cut the cake the had already melted dissolved into the frosting i used them on white frosting and they were very had to see even at application bottom line i would not recommend this product,-1
i love french vanilla coffee and was looking forward to this it turned out to be a huge disappointment because all i could taste was the milk i put in the coffee when you read reviews of the keurig coffee makers people recommend using bolder darker roasts the van houtte french vanilla is a light roast so i obviously knew it was not going to be strong but to be devoid of any flavor is not acceptable when i made the coffee this morning i even paused the keurig during the brew cycle to wet the grounds better in order to produce a more flavorful cup i also used the oz setting rather than the oz setting on my machine none of this had any effect the coffee pouring into my cup was a nice rich color but there was no coffee or vanilla aroma emanating from it in this case i honestly do not understand the positive reviews on this product i actually like light roasts but this is the first time i have had one that left me wondering where the coffee and the vanilla flavor was,-1
i have always loved hearts of palm but not these ones the taste is good but these roland hearts of palm are hard as rocks it may appear unbelievable but only one stem out of ten were eatable i would need special dog like teeth to eat these will look for another brand of softer and more teeth friendly ones,-1
i was truly disappointed when i received this product it did not work with my machine and it was a total waste of money,-1
a friend from chili gave me some coco matte tea and it will show up positive for cocaine on a drug test be aware if you have to have drug tests,-1
when i received the shipment the packing box was in great condition i opened it to find the box tightly packed with bubble wrap and securely taped with shipping tape it took a box cutter to remove the protective bubble wrap once removed i found the can of cherries so badly dented and damaged that it looked like it had been dropped from a third story window and there was no way to even attempt to open it it had clearly been wrapped for shipping in that condition my only conclusion was that the product is being sold by a distributer who has a a badly damaged shipment that they need to unload because they can not sell it to their usual restaurant clients to amazon is credit when i contacted them about the problem they responded to my email within about two hours and had credited the cost of the purchase back to my credit card by the end of the same day,-1
they missed christmas delivery by days customer service is very unknowledgeable google reviews for them before buying,-1
coffee was not bad but the majority of k cup pods malfunctioned and sent coffee grounds everywhere spent more time cleaning brewer than enjoying coffee even when they did not blow up there were always grounds in the coffee,-1
wow eat a few and you are fine eat a half of handful and you will be popping in a few hours eat a handful or more and you better stay near a bathroom for the rest of the day these taste great just like the regular ones but they will affect you in more ways than one,-1
first let me say that the product itself is excellent and i have no problems with it this review is mainly about amazon is idea of proper packaging i ordered this with super saver shipping and it will be the last time from now on i will order from another vendor and pay for shipping when i received the package it was stained and cans had been so severely damaged that they were leaking others were questionable and others were severely dented but safe to use i work in a canning facility so i know how to test vacuum in cans the product was packaged with no padding at all in a box that was a good deal larger than the item i saved no money at all on free shipping as i had to discard cans of an already expensive cat food,-1
the bread will not toast no matter how long you leave it in the toaster the taste was not appealing too sour not a good texture for sandwiches,-1
very disappointing compared to trader joe is or el toro this is inferior great if you want to develop lockjaw or use in a stew that you cook for a few days,-1
oh convenience you bring me back time and again to products that i should probably know better than to try like the other dozen or so one star reviewers i picked up this mix for some quick brownies and wound up with a full blown gluten reaction bloating pain nausea the whole deal i know this was the source of the problem because i have not had anything new different or strange in a week or so it could not have been the xantham gum because i had a very small portion if the laxative effect is that strong in what would normally be considered a very very small brownie by then too much xantham gum is being used the sad thing is i used my brand new non stick baking pan for this and now have to replace it for the unaware gluten can hang on in plastic silicone and non stick coatings i am just glad i had these after my anaphylacticly allergic child went to bed,-1
it tasted like slightly flavored watered down coconut water i have had coconut water before and it tasted much better i did not like it,-1
i would been looking for an apple preserve and harvest song seemed to fit the bill they have got a wonderfully idyllic print marketing campaign so i thought i would take a chance as it turns out the aluminum lid on the jar has no protective liner my first of a teaspoon was filled with metal the acid in the jam had corroded the interior of the lid producing scratch marks that looked like someone scratched it with the tines of a fork i am calling amazon to see if they will refund on defective food really people run for your lives update i felt a little sick from this product but it cleared up in about hours when i felt better i called amazon through the contact us link near the bottom of the page and received a full refund thanks for the great customer service amazon,-1
a somewhat decent blended of peaty islay malts the rumor is that it used to contain mostly lagavulin but i do not know if there is any truth to that the fact is the bottler probably buys casks of whatever islay distiller has over produced the result is that the flavors change from bottle to bottle not bad just different a cheaper way to sample the flavors of islay,-1
i also bought two of these as gifts and will be returning them for the same reason as some of the others unacceptable packaging unless you have already tried the product there is nothing about this that makes you want to try it i assumed big mistake that there would be some kind of packaging but there was not this is really sad too because the product is great,-1
these olives tasted very metallic to me as well as guests for whom i had prepared a couscous salad i will not order them again,-1
this product contains non organic monsatan soy lecithin banned in europe causes cancer and organ failure in lab rats organic sources of soy lecithin are presently available no good reason to use this poison most of the companies that use it have been bought out by the same mega corps that make junk food etc usda organic products are allowed to contain gmos,-1
started out ok but after a few weeks my dog decided she did not like the taste all that much became picky and would not finish her feedings i ended up discarding a half bag and switching to wellness brand puppy mix canidae does produce very dense dark stools so if you have to pick up poop this makes it easy with a fenced yard i do not bother,-1
i had high hopes for these based on the other reviews i wanted to like them but i really do not nor do my husband or son to us they taste nothing like real pretzels and are definitely not worth the calories fat or price i know that this is because they lack the gluten but they are not very crunchy more like crisp since they are not dense at all they also have a funky sort of metallic aftertaste,-1
honestly and simply this product was not a good one certainly not good based on my personal experience the beef jerky was so extremely tough and difficult to chew many pieces were so tough that they were literally inedible additionally i ordered the teriyaki jerky and it had a very weak or light flavor,-1
i am from west bengal india i grew up with finest quality darjeeling and assam tea i never got such good tea here in the us all the glowing reviews made me buy this tea thinking that i would at last find a good tea the tea is simply horrible i am not sure how the other buyers are making this tea but this tea is far from strong and it has no flavor two packs of simple lipton tea make a better cup do not waste your money on this one,-1
this item looks very good in the picture but does not even look closer to the description there is no tray but an ugly plastic wrapped package very disappointed and want to return it and not buy from this reseller,-1
these were not fresh and very hard to chew without much flavor would never buy again,-1
i ordered this coffee after reading reviews on amazon usually those reviews are really helpful but not in this case the coffee does not have a nice taste it is not better than any grocery store brand it is flavor is strong but not in a good way rather like badly roasted coffee i know some people like fruity acidic flavor and some like nutty flavor like me in their coffee but melitta coffee has neither it is more like coffee flavored mud on top of all i was not able to return the coffee because it turns out amazon does not allow returns on some grocery items if you doubt my review because of all other glorifying reviews well when i ordered this coffee there was not even a single negative review that is the way i was fooled however if you do not care much about the quality of coffee but just need caffeine this coffee may be right choice for you if you care about the taste of your coffee at all avoid melitta even for this price trust me it does not worth,-1
i have been cutting back on my salt intake and thought this product would be good however it contains soooo much black pepper it is the first ingredient listed on the label i can not use much to season my food because the black pepper is overwhelming and then the food is too spicy and bothers my stomach i can not recommend this product,-1
i love orange blossom honey tried this for convenience factor but disappointed with this product the flavor is hardly distinguishable when placed in my tea i tried sticks same thing not worth it i went back to my other brand with the squeeze bottle,-1
i saw an earlier ad today from this seller daily market offering king arthur bread flour in a lb bag for i was sort of suspicious about this because i have never seen kaf bread flour in anything more than a bag so i contacted king arthur flour co about this basically what they indicated is that their bread flour is available in various combinations of lb bags but if it is a lb it is not legitimate as kaf does not package their bread flour in anything larger than lb bags,-1
i spent dollares for a tiny box of cookies and some pc samples this is the biggest rip off,-1
i would tried taste of the wild bison venison about a month back for my first time the first bag was great the dogs loved it and everything went well i ordered a second bag about a month later i have a red heeler puppy about and a year old jrt blue heeler on it when i opened the bag it had a very strong smell much stronger than the first bag i had not thought much of it until after the dogs ate the puppy got sick after eating his first bowl of the second bag he was whimpering a lot and just could not keep anything down and my has been having serious gas and diarrhea now they both will not touch the stuff i picked up a bag of some other stuff at the local petsmart and they are both eating fine so i am not sure if there are some quality control issues or i just got a bad bag but i will be trying something else,-1
this is my favorite decaf k cup thus far and the price on amazon is the best except when half the cups break in the keurig i have not experienced this with any of my other amazon k cup orders and it is probably just a bad batch of k cups but since i have seen other comments about this problem as well i thought i should add to it to warn customers and hopefully encourage timothy is to better their quality control,-1
i was so excited for this to arrive because i love orgain drinks and this has two benefits over orgain the first benefit is the drink is larger in size oz versus oz and it has a twist off cap that you can put back on which orgain does not this unfortunately is where the benefits end for this product orgain tastes so much better and also has more vitamins in it i do not know if it is the soy milk or what but the taste of this is absolutely horrible it is like a bad medicine after taste i purchased this because of all of the positive reviews on amazon and because of the packaging versus orgain i was really hoping this would be great but i now have eleven containers of this stuff that i will never drink i cannot stress how bad this was to me but maybe you will like it since so many others do i wish that i would have purchased an individual bottle before buying a whole case but that was my own fault for not doing so do not make the same mistake i did,-1
menadione sodium bisulfite complex source of vitamin k is a severely toxic synthetic form of vitamin k can cause severe liver damage and carrageenan as well i would never feed my cat that food,-1
i do not know how this company dares to label this as chocolate fudge brownie as it tastes absolutely nothing like that a lot of so called flavored coffees have disappointingly little of the flavor they have supposedly added to the coffee but this one had none at all it did not even smell like the titled flavor what is worse other flavored coffees with disappointingly little of the flavor they supposedly added at least still taste like decent coffee this one does not i even tried mixing it with some folgers coffee to use it up and noticed it brought down the quality of the folgers brew please save yourself from this distasteful experience and purchase something else,-1
this is a great product i love mojitos but they are hard to come by since fresh mint isnt a usual item to stock at bars homes etc bottled mixes will do but i cant help but notice they dont taste homemade so sadly i go without i just had my first large glass of this mojito slushy and couldnt be happier with the flavor the blend is perfect tart sweet and minty the slushy consistency helps give it an effervescent quality making it is the simplest thing add rum to this line add optional flavored liquor to this line add warm water shake then finish adding more water to this line freeze hours i actually made it two days ago but after letting it thaw while i was taking a bath it was a happy happy pick me up i plan to always keep some of the bags in stock at my place which i may or may not share with visitors this is something i can indulge in and not feel the least bit selfish if theyve never had something they dont know what they are missing right,1
i delayed purchasing it i have a limit and barista runs twice that until i found it on sale having used keurig pots since they first came out a decade ago and having tried about flavors i am going to put this coffee right up in the top i prefer it is italian brother slightly but find this coffee to be both bold enough for my tastes and smooth enough for my partner is taste we have a house full of guests now and the carousel has dozens of different coffees on it but the barista is the one i keep having to refill but it is not good enough to cost a found them for a k cup box of,1
usually after a new kibble is introduced even with gradual transitioning dog vomits right after meal time for a few weeks but he has not vomited once after weeks of this kibble switched from blue buffalo because of the protein to grain ratio and also quality of ingredients well worth the upgrade in terms of cost per pound,1
i suppose that indoor cats have different needs than outdoor ones when i ordered this product i was in a real hurry and i got the first dry cat food i saw when it arrived i read indoors and thought will it be enough for year old frederick and romeo and juliet my active year old cats not to mention the bunch of guests from the block that visit us constantly well i do not speak meow but they empty the plates faster than i serve and i guess that it means we love it grandma as for activity they are as mischievous as always,1
i was not expecting a whole lot out of a ready to eat meal but this gopicnic combination was a pleasant surprise there was enough stuff to actually fill me up for a quick lunch though i have to admit i added some carrot sticks and a nonfat oz yogurt and i am a pound male the salmon dip and ritz like crackers are the main course the chili lime flavoring is mild at first but builds on you the edamame are crispy and salty and are not objectionable at all while the fruit and nut mix and dark chocolate square round out the mix very pleasant for around per meal these are not cheap but are not outrageous for quality all natural foods without trans fats or high fructose corn syrup while the package itself is only oz compared to say a lean cuisine at around oz it still may be worth it for you especially if you do not want to have to worry about refrigeration or microwaving i would not hesitate to buy one again so i am not stuck going out to eat at work and consuming more calories than i really need but it is definitely not an every week thing and do not expect anything real filling,1
i am not even a fan of chocolate but i love this and you can only find it in stores during the holidays so i had to get some,1
i was already a fan of this granola if you do not like to break up your granola you will hate it it is like a granola bar so you have to turn it into cereal on your own i think the taste is great,1
did what they said good price and showed up early i buy this item regularly and this was the best service i have had will remember next time,1
i originally found this seasoning a few years ago at walmart i used it at christmas and our family loves it sweet potatoes without it seem really bland and boring now that we have tried this seasoning i can no longer find it in our stores so i was really glad to find i could buy it on line i bought enough that i could also include it in gift giving try it,1
the dog food arrived within the expected time and the product quality was as expected and my dog liked it to the last cup,1
i am not sure why they call these skallops there is nothing about them that is even vaguely reminiscent of scallops but they can easily pass for chicken nuggets in both texture and taste maybe this product has been around since before there was such a thing as a chicken nugget get yourself some dipping sauce and you have got a winner on your hands,1
i will start with the nutritional health aspect this oz snack is filling at calories not much nutritional value dv calcium dv iron high fiber moderate sodium not a lot of sugar in all probably not good couch food but is a filling compact snack when on the go and you need a lift or maybe for the mini breakfast eater the texture issue somewhat sticky gooey pastey with a wee bit of crumbling when attacked none of it excessive flavor is quite good i particularly enjoyed the large identifiable walnut pieces rather than the micro specs you get in some snack bars i do not care for raisins they are in there but they are soft and whole if you like them the spice taste was pleasantly muted and there was a remote banana flavor maybe the agave coconut sweetening yummy the texture issue aside which i suspect had to do with the high fiber content i will give this filling good tasting and reasonably healthy snack a full stars,1
i ordered the ennova evo cat food at the recommendation of our vetrinarian we have cats both grand old ladies and one had developed diabetes in the last months she was on insulin after starting both cats on the innova evo our diabetic cat has been able to stop the insulin injections altogether nothing short of amazing as far as we are concerned we will never feed our animals anything else,1
wow is what i said when i first opened up the bag and tried these bad boys they are super crispy thin and have the right amount of salt they also taste like they were just fried which i really love i think these chips closely resemble chipolte is chips and that is a very good thing because i love their chips go out and try these you will not regret it,1
note this is a cross posting of my review of the napa garden variety of this product placed here because this seems to be where all the reviews are going what we are dealing with here is a container of mixed seasonings with a very helpful label they do not reveal exactly which herbs are included but it is a good mix that works well with the straight up test take a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar sprinkle the seasoning on top and then dip a chunk of italian bread in it and ciao down the label is much more helpful than most mixed seasoning labels it provides you with simple recipes for mixing with olive or other light oil and a variety of other ingredients to produce salad dressings marinades dry rubs etc in the straight up test the taste was full and herbanescent if that is not a real word tough i made it up and i like it the sea salt and lemon juice added just the right tang and the tomato worked well with all the spices and salt to add just a tiny hint of fruity freshness,1
i have been drinking yamamotoyama genmai cha for years when i lived in the sf bay area i could buy it off the shelf in many grocery stores since moving away i have not been so lucky my online order was delivered quickly,1
we use all of arora is spice packets they are an ideal compromise convenience food wholesome authentically spicy yet easy to prepare the only way to come close to this quality is to stock the individual spices yourself and create your own mix not a bad idea but in the meantime this is a great way to go we always use at least one large fresh green hot pepper and often add one or two dried peppers often chipotles as well for a fuller more fiery flavor serve these dishes with plain yogurt and some naan and you are livin,1
altho i read that some folks said they only got a few flavors that was notthe case when i got my sack of imperfect bellys great mix of colors andflavors worked wonderfully for christmas goodie packages will not hesitate to use again,1
i do not belong to sam is club anymore so this is great fo me the price is more then the for sam is club but this price has free hipping if you pick the correct seller we use this cheese all of the time in our food it is still the best price that i can find for online food orders,1
these taste like rich little butter cookies and the kids love them they are beautifully shaped which appeals to my three year old daughter who likes to name the animals as she eats them,1
this is a good alternative to fake cheese and artificial ingredients and harmful colors the pasta is not that healthy at all but it is good enough to eat as a treat we like it to much probably the same company makes the bad kind too so i hate to support that but you have to have some fun,1
great mix tastes just as i remember is great gift as i have sent some on to irish friends and they have raved about it also only one problem can not stop eating it when it comes out of the oven enjoy,1
we were told the item would be delivered on or about february and it was not actually shipped until march the information should be more accurate thank you,1
i have been using this on a daily basis for well over a year each three pound bag lasts about a month for me supplying the protein component for me and my wife is smoothies on its own the hemp protein is pretty harsh i used to fill up a shaker with ounces of water and cup of this stuff and gag gulp it down besides the fact that it does not mix at all with water it is somewhat vile in its purest form it is actually a bit more pleasant than a few other brands when consumed alone when a serving is added to some hemp oil almond milk and fruits it falls into balance and the nuttiness of the hemp stands out nicely the grittiness also becomes unnoticeable in my smoothies and i am using an inexpensive blender i have also started making nutrition bars with this stuff and so far so good i have seen a huge debate here and elsewhere about the quality of hemp protein i am privileged enough to choose a diet that makes me feel good and remain healthy since this is not my sole source of protein i am not concerned that i will get kwashiorkor in case anyone still feels like maintaining the potential negative of switching to a hemp protein only diet in fact i feel that i have come upon a period of peak health and i will say that this purchase plays a significant role the price has fluctuated by quite a bit as of late but i use subscribe and save to get the most bang for my buck in short i highly recommended this product if you are using it in a smoothie or nutrition bar,1
i received two free samples what a delicious cereal for snack or breakfast it was great to take to work for an inbetween snack to get me to lunch without feeling starving,1
my cat loved it so i did give it stars for quality and taste my one problem with it and the reason i did not give it stars is that petite cuisine is made in thailand i did not notice the label when i got this at first i am going on a green kick lately and it seems to be a shame thatyou can make this product in another country ship it here and the company can save money with all that overhead i wish it was made in the u s a part of going green is buying locally,1
i bought the greenpowder green tea and tastes great the jasmine also has a great taste and aroma unfortunately amazon has increased its price close to in a about a month i do not imagine the tea having increased by that amount in the stores,1
i ordered this coffee cause it was the cheapest k cups i could find any whereon the internet do not let the inexpensive price fool you van houtte has some taste rich quality blends my only complaint i went through ten boxes way too fast i am more annoyed at the grocery chains because they do not keep k cup coffees on their shelves,1
i was hoping this was good natural muesli i did not want anything similar to something i could purchase in a grocery store bob is red mill did not disappoint this is a chewy tasty very slightly sweet muesli delicious healthy very filling great cold w milk or served warm if you want sweeter add a little honey or a banana when you eat healthy you will feel it your body will thank you a huge plus the price is very good health food stores charge a lot more for less quantity and less quality thanks amazon and bob is red mill great partnership that benefits our health happy healthy new year,1
i was never a huge peanut butter fan especially as it is so high in fat but i recently had stomach surgery and need higher protein foods i figured on adding this to my protein shakes to boost the protein level it tastes great in my chocolate shakes so i decided to try it plain i truly fell in love with the taste at once i now eat it on a high protein wrap with a bit of low sugar strawberry jam this is an amazing substitute for the real thing and i actually think it is better,1
a delight to eat and also makes a unique gift only negative i have is the confusion over free shipping there was a link for free shipping eligibility via amazon but the shipping costs was included in the costs of the popcorn this was confusing and misleading,1
received the product exactly as described sunflower oil is definitely gives food a different taste than olive oil and other vegetable oils more expensive but nice for a change,1
if you love the chai tea latte offered at starbucks this is it i prefer my chai over ice i mix chai vanilla soy milk and regular milk in any amount this drink makes a sweet blend of yummy goodness that i drink about times a day,1
this a great price for the quantity you get arrowroot powder is so expensive if you buy it in the spice section of the supermarket buying online is much cheaper it is a great thickening agent has same consistency as corn flour i use this to make primal paleo bread made from almond flour,1
this item was found to be a soothing and relaxing drink settles the nerves and have a tendency to make one loose weight i would recommend this tea to any one,1
if you use oregano as we do in any volume you will be hard pressed to find it in regular grocery stores my wife is puerto rican and uses this to make sofrito the quality is good and the price is really fair compared to small containers in the grocery when you can find it,1
this product is delicious just like from the old country and good for those who watch their weight i will soon order more,1
as soon as my dogs see this little bag of goodness they go crazy these treats are an absolutely wonderful little snack for them my youngest has a lot of problems eating different things and she just goes mad for these we would highly recommend these for any dog,1
seems i can rarely find these in stores close to me i love them the only problem i had with this item was that there were so many i could not eat them all before they went bad a smaller purchase would have been wiser for me,1
this is the best of all the non sugar products to add sweetness and i have tried them all i just feel it is a bit pricey forthe average person on an average to fixed income to purchase with more people using it i hope the price can go down a bit i especially like the fact it is made from the stevia plant notjust a host of chemicals,1
go picnic was a hit but the package came with a snack bag with peanuts i thought it was peanut free gluten free yikes so grateful my daughter can read is responsible to read ingredients of everything new she eats something to be careful of if you are buying for children with nut allergies as well other than that she has enjoyed other items in her treat box my daughters quote it was tasty,1
feels great smells great and tastes great pure and heavy cookwith it spread it on your skin and enjoy it,1
we love these cookies even my daughter who does not have to eat gf they are crunchy and flavor is good do not taste gf highly recommend we will continue to purchase these regularly,1
i have been using this product for a year now and i want to say that it smells really good i use it to seal moisture in my hair i read on the package that you can also cook with it i have not tried that yet but it smells good enough to cook with i worried about the oil becoming solid in cooler temperatures but surprisingly it stays liquified no matter what temperature it is not greasy at all very light and coats the hair shaft well i highly recommend,1
did not know what to do with this spice initially since i have never used it before but i love moroccan food it seemed quite fresh upon smelling it i used it as a dry rub on chicken as well as a marinade in yogurt garlic lime and olive oil i used it i n the crock pot too worked perfectly with all those techniques i am quite impressed with the seller as well as with the spice itself it proves such deep and rich north african flavors i am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it to adventurous gourmet cooks who enjoy middle eastern food,1
way better than peanut butter tastes like heaven you will never go back to regular peanut butter again its got all the taste and is probably better for you somehow,1
yummy we gobbled it right up only issue is the unit price the portions are so small yet it is so expensive is this stuff really that expensive to make that it is like a lb,1
great price great quality quick ship if you use lots of capers this the place to buy it i am ready to oder two more jars,1
snappy white popcorn is one of the best popcorn i have ever tried very tasty and most every kernel pops every time,1
these taste great and are soft and easy to chew the spicy could be more spicey in my opinion,1
i bought this product with high hopes seeing as how great the reviews were so i purchased order of the count bags these bags claim to be resistant to leaks however are no different from my medela or lansinoh breast milk storage bags that have leaked when the first bag leaked the leak occurred at the seam located at the bottom of the bag i thought it was just a fluke however i have now had over bags leak thankfully i was able to see the leak immediately when transferring my pumped milk to the bag for a few but i can not say the same with the bags i have taken from the freezer to thaw not only did i lose precious milk i had a huge mess to clean up in my fridge i still want to really like these bags but they keep letting me down who ever said there is no use crying over spilled milk obviously was not talking about breast milk very disappointing update although it was unfortunate circumstances that brought me to give honeysuckle a bad rating of out of stars after dealing with their customer service and receiving replacement bags i have to give them a higher rating even though some bags were faulty from the first order i purchased the replacement bags seem to be holding up thus far i greatly appreciate working with companies who appreciate their customers and honeysuckle is probably one of the best customer service experiences i have come across,1
i love these k cups so much they are perfect for me i like tea sweet but not too sweet they are perfect i brew them on the or option over ice and they turn out great i tried being cheap and brewing over it again but that just made the second glass taste like watered down iced tea so i just make it regular now i highly recommend these to anyone who likes their tea sweet and wants it quick,1
i love this stuff i will be back for more if you have it in your stock very good deal and service was excellent i will be back,1
this cheese is wonderful and i would buy again true romano with a zesty flavor fresh with no clumps a great buy for grated romano cheese,1
i like to consider myself an olive connoisseur i just love olives and have tasted just about every kind these have got to be the most perfect olive because they have the right amount of brine and firmness to make it such so many other olives i have tasted were usually too salty and too soft but these are absolutely delicious i bought them for martinis but found myself eating them like a snack and i cannnot stop eating them they are actually addictive i will be sure to stock on these goodies because they will be gone very soon plus the extremely fast free prioirty mail shipping from amazon makes it a great and convenient deal,1
i love these gummies i can not eat anything that contains tapioca or corn products and these are the only gummies i have found that do not have either the best part is that they taste really good,1
this is a great morning cup of coffee i select the largest brew cup on the keurig and it makes a perfect cup of coffee i would recommend this to anyone who likes a great cup of coffee but does not have time to go to a drive thru,1
these snacks are such a great finger food unlike a lot of other snacks for toddlers we have tried they actually taste good my only problem is wanting to eat them before i give them to my daughter they are not messy and are the perfect size for little fingers the fruit melts very quickly in my daughters mouth and is so easy for her to eat all the flavors are excellent but this is our favorite both the blueberries and apples taste fresh and sweet but with no added sweetener great job designing a healthy snack for young children,1
i am a repeat customer this is always the best price fastest shipping and best of all most affordable syrup products thanks for selling on amazon com,1
this product is rich an creamy quick to fix an enjoymuch better than i make an the price is certainly affordablegreat snack midnight munchie an add salad garlic bread good meal for lunch or dinner,1
i have used the buster cube for years with various dogs it is by far the best interactive treat toy believe me i have tried everything and always come back to this cube you will not be disappointed,1
i am giving this product stars because i think it is great considering that it is made with water the hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size if you want a large cup of hot chocolate use k cups it is fairly low in calories most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little k cup,1
we first started our little guy with spinach peas pear and he loves it now we continue on with brocoli apple and he also loves it i tasted both and they are pretty good just a little bit sweet for my taste so we give it to him only once a day and feed him earth is best organic baby food without veggie fruit combo for his other meals,1
i have read where people have received dried out goji is i can say that this was not the case for me they have a touch more moisture than a raisin however in my opinion they are far more tasty and versatile in addition to being an incredibly healthy item to consume we use ours in a variety of things from homemade trail mix to being mixed into our waffle batter to a salad topping and finally we use them in our green smoothies as well i anticipate finding more uses for them but for now that is what we have tried i would like to say also that ounces of goji berries goes a long way i thought we would have gone through the bag in two weeks but a almost a month in with daily use for two people we still have around half a bag so that falls in line with the recommended one delivery every two months for the subscribe and save subscription anyways i highly recommend this product if you are attentive to your health at all and for vegetarians vegans we are the latter it is a must have for your kitchen enjoy,1
i love this product tazo has produced a mild yet sweet and spicy tea that i can only call magic sweet cinnamon spice has a flavor all on it is own and i highly recommend it for adventurous spice tea drinkers looking for that perfect balance,1
i ordered a big box of hooves i got a big box of hooves my dogs love them i have seen some other reviews whose authors were offended by the presence or lack of a shiny polished look but who cares not the dogs these hooves do have a little bit of a barnyard smell especially when they are wet and chewed on which is why i have only given them stars instead of i will keep buying them though this is a terrific price they might be a little smellier than the ones i can buy in the store locally but the price makes it worth it,1
i love tea and while i like to use boiled water to make tea these k cups allow me to make a fast cup of tea whenever i want it,1
after having wonderful super salty scandinavian liquorice for a number of years i was excited to see that i could order these on amazon sadly though they were not as salty as i was looking for regardless this liquorice is great and the shipping was fast as always,1
pig ears arrived in great shape and before estimated delivery time much more economical than per store who did not have them in bulk like i received although my wife thought i was nuts to pay that much for pig ears at one time they are large enough to cut in half i use my shop band saw and have enough for a log time to come,1
not only does this juice mix make the world is best bloody mary i enjoy a can w o liquor of course each morning in place of tomato juice with my breakfast it is out of this world i prefer it to also i add precisely three drops of tabasco for a nice little kick be careful with the tabasco though because you could very easily overdo it and ruin the drink please note that this review is for the original bloody mary mix they have several variants such as spicy etc my favorite is the original,1
a decent pasta with an average sauce comparable to jarred barilla is my usual pasta and mezze penne something i always stock at home so i was curious how their prepackaged meals are the very brief microwaving results in a penne a little softer than my usual al dente but surprisingly normal pasta despite coming out of a microwave package the sauce is a generic marinara edible but nothing exciting similar to jarred if you make your own sauces which i highly recommend very easy this sauce will taste a bit fake to you it has only minor heat despite being labeled spicy although that may be versus sugar heavy old fashioned american marinaras but for us spice lovers i added both cayenne and red pepper flakes to get to the preferred level of zing the microwave tray is a coated paperboard with a plastic insert for the sauce so it is not all plastic i try to avoid heating food in plastic when possible the serving is a lightweight calories at my recommended calorie daily intake this would qualify as a snack these seem like they would be expensive per meal compared to making pasta yourself and too low calorie to be a meal by themselves for most adults but still handy if you have poor kitchen access or for brown bagging to work school recommended for a quick pasta meal,1
very good licorice it is like a soft carmel with a licorice flavor that is not to strong and very fresh,1
i could not believe how big these were i have easily spent the money on rawhide at the pet store will not be doing that anymore,1
if you like the old fashioned english fish chips you will love a sprinkle of this malt vinegar on it delicious ordered and arrived in a flash,1
i had this milk nearly every day for two years while living in chile it is very delicious much better than the non fat stuff sold here in the states i found that adding a little bit of sugar really made it great,1
i drink lots of both hot and iced tea i have been buying the unit of small boxes of tea which means i have a cardboard outer box and smaller tea boxes for the recycle bin but when i ordered this large box of stash tea inside were the individual tea bags which means i have just one box to recycle this is a great way to purchase large quantities of tea bags and from now on i am going to purchase my tea in these large boxes as long as amazon offers them it is much easier than opening and recycling individual boxes as to stash teas well they are the best i love this white lemon and have not been unhappy with any of their teas,1
i received this oil as a gift from a friend who brought it from france it is fantastic on shrimp and fish since i live in the middle of nowhere and am not planning a trip to france for a while i am glad i can buy it at amazon even if the shipping price is so high,1
okay the title is a little crude but are not we all a little oral for some reason harder and harder to find in the stores i buy these by the carton and find myself sharing with friends great for the breath low in calories an upper for the taste buds i think they are as good as the original that come in the tube and are full of sugar and i am so happy amazon carries them,1
this is advertised as garlic mayonnaise on amazon but on the other side of the jar it clearly states in french sauce aioli in case you were wondering this was delivered with amazon prime shipping without the added expense of shipping when buying from eurogrocer i hope it comes back in stock as it goes great with seafood,1
these are our favorite canned lentils some of the other canned lentils we have tried have had larger than expected beans but these are a much smaller bean we originally found these at our local whole foods but they were often sold out or in low supply needless to say we were very happy to find that amazon also stocks these lentils although they are often in low supply here as well these lentils make a great substitute for using dried lentils and are awesome for anyone following a slow carb diet such as the diet described by tim ferriss in his book four hour body this product is imported from italy,1
i love these little pucker makers just thinking about them is making my mouth water the container has more than you would ever dream of they are a perfect little sweet snack and great for morning sickness i love these guys,1
this mix makes a good pancake reason for stars it says blueberry well we saw a few in the mix however there was not a hint of blueberry taste even if you got one in your pancake the mix does make a good texture pancake how ever,1
i research everything i buy one thing i wanted was to make homemade babyfood i spent weeks watching videos online and reading all i could i made a list of everything i would need and marked videos to remember how to make each food then i found the baby brezza i heard about the babycook and thought about buying that one however the baby brezza has one button that not only steams the food but then purees it automatically after it steams babycook does not as i write this review the steamer just stopped and started to puree i am in the living room playing with my baby as the babyfood makes itself in the kitchen all i had to do was buy the veggies and fruits i bought organic and then peeled followed the steamer time in the recipe book it came with and that is it this is a busy working moms dream i just poured the puree into ice cube trays to freeze and i can not wait to feed them to my little one i would highly recommend this product if you are at a loss of where to start and want something super easy i bought organic carrots in a jar last week for cents for ounces i did the math tonight and i was able to make organice sweet potatos for cents for ounces carrots would have probably been even cheaper i know using kitchen gadgets i already owned would make it even cheaper but since i bought it for convience and not for the cost saving money is a bonus and it will pretty much pay for itself and it was cheaper than the baby cook so happy and my little one loves the baby food i have made so far,1
its not the greatest hot chocolate but for the price you pay its worth it i prefer godiva is hot chocolate over this any day however i have no issues buying this again for the price,1
this is our favorite tomato product works great in sauces unlike other reviewers i had no problems with the packaging or dented cans the was well packed in multiple layers of bubble wrap,1
i was very happy with this tasty coffee the beans are small and very flavorful it makes me wonder if young coffee beans are preferable to fully grown ones hills brothers has been in this business for a long time they know what they are doing very nice indeed,1
if you are ever in the need for an exotic alternative in your regular soup routine then try nile spice soups nile spice lentil curry couscous soup is a light blend of curry turmeric and other east west indian spices although the soup lacks the punch of spiciness one would expect from a true indian or caribbean curry dish the soup is still a delicious meal as a person who is allergic to monosodium glumate msg i am glad to have found a brand of instant soup meals that does not contain this harmful food additive the soup does have a slightly high sodium content percentage at however most processed items containing sodium are within the same percentile try the nile spice lentil curry couscous soup today and be whisked away into a unique aroma from half way around the world,1
the flavor is true vanilla its very good since maxwell house discontinued their vanilla flavor i had to find a replacement and this was the closest to it at a reasonable price maxwell house will be sorry they didnt listen to me when i spoke to marketing dept oh well folgers good fortune instead i purchase by the for the office and i also purchase it for home it tastes great,1
this gf cereal is decent does not get soggy easily and is relatively good i was a huge fan of apple cinnamon cheerios before going gluten free and these really do not compare well but the cereal does not taste like cardboard and does not have the weird gluten free taste to it and is actually pretty good,1

when i first heard about coconut oil i laughed but i researched it and figured it would not hurt me to try it out i have only been using for a week and swear by it excellent for cooking is a very good appetite suppressant great for skin and hair also i am a nibbler and from the first day of trying this i do not nibble all day i eat a healthy breakfast cooking with the coconut oil add a bit to the coffee i take with me i eat half what i normally would have for lunch and i am not hungry again until i get off work and it is time for dinner then i only have a lite dinner i also do not experience that slump,1
i take a tablespoon of knox gelatine every day to keep my joints healthy and pain free i am and i have been doing this for many years and it is very effective,1
personally i am not a very big fan of instant coffee but honestly this is the best instant coffee i have tried i really like it i usually have it with a little bit of dark chocolate i would suggest you to try it out it is a wonderful combination,1
this made the best kahlua pork for my son is luau party tasted great i will say this is a lot of salt be prepared to store it for a while i have also used it in a salt grinder for smaller grain salt tastes different than kosher or other salts nice product,1
i purchased this butter flavor for in october which was a good price oz compared with other offerings i used drops in an ice cream called savannah buttermint and it added a substantial deep butter flavor the ingredient seems perfectly good for home cooking though since drops delivered so much flavor i do not see how i will ever use the rest of the bottle,1
for bisli lovers who can not decide between bbq and smokey flavors good combination fresh full of flavor and a great value,1
have you ever had some gardetto is snack mix there is some round dark brown chips in there that look like bagel chips and taste terrific they are so good i fish them out of the bag i must not be the only person who thinks those are the best part of gardetto is snack mix because gardettos made a special request bag containing nothing else but these roasted garlic rye chips now you do not have to share you can hide a bag in a drawer for whenever you need a garlic rush,1

i opened my first pack of leonidas chocolate to find them completely melted i thought for certain i was out i skeptically emailed the company through the amazon provided link expecting never to hear back not only did i hear back by later that evening but the next day i had a new package of chocolate in perfect condition with no additonal charge the chocolate in and of itself is great but i believe that good customer service especially in this day and age should be commended i would highly recommend both the chocolate and the company and will be doing business with them again,1
tassimo is the only system that has starbucks coffee there are more choices of coffee with other companies but now after drinking starbucks from tassimo i do not think i would be able to drink other coffees on a regular basis starbucks medium house blend and colombia are strong enough for great taste and stimulation for more than half the day if i drink it at pm or after i have trouble sleeping and i am a coffee addict i prefer colombia though breakfast blend is light for me and bold ones verona and others are too strong and bitter it is expensive but coffee is one of my luxuries and it makes my mood better so i will live with that once you drink starbucks from tassimo you will not even enjoy the one from the starbuck cafe i also recommend seattle blends and somewhat maxwell for a lighter coffee i do interrupt the cycle to make it stronger though but it is cheaper,1
i tried these mixed nut bars several months ago and really liked them i buy them often but now have found out that the store where i buy them does not carry them anymore i am really panicked now yes they are sweet and salty but they taste great i usually do not like granola bars of any kind but these are different and a great fill in if there is no time for lunch i know they have sugar and salt and they may be a bit higher in calorie but the difference if i can eat these because they do not taste like cardboard,1
so nice and smooth i break little pieces off and let them melt in my mouth sometimes when i can actually not chew it up it is a very nice bitter sweet chocolate i love it thank goodness nobody else around here likes it at all i can have it all to myself,1
the switch in kiwi berry is quite tasty it is very berry but not quite kiwi the kiwi is very subdued seems like it enhances the tartness of the berry but does not quite warrant kiwi in the flavor title the switch is a good replacement for traditional sugar corn syrup laden sodas it is not necessarily lower in carbs as the sweetness comes from the juices for me as a diabetic i would use these instead of coke or juice boxes when treating a hypoglycemic episode my child does not like anything sparkling but if i had kids who liked soda i would probably try to move them over to something like this actually probably to water or sparkling water with a splash of juice for special occasions the flavor is very sweet even though it is natural from the juices and very tasty the carbonation is light and sparkling the flavor and carbonation reminded me of martinelli is sparkling apple cider but a little more fun,1
yes i did try one they taste very bland actually to me they had very little flavor but my rabbits and the dog love them kind of expensive but if you get them at the per bag rates you are getting a big bargain even with the shipping and handling i actually ordered some treats from a different business that sells bunny treats and found it was this same product repackaged a smaller amount in the bag and a bigger price so i checked amazon and found that the identical items were sold as doggie treats in a bigger bag and less cost on top of that nice savings i do not have a car at the moment so i can not drive to the pet store the animals fight each other to be first in the handout line i wish i could get the recipe for them and i would like to buy them in a bag does anyone sell them that way they would make a nice doggie christmas present,1
my new buddhas palm just arrived in the mail priority mail was packed excellent and a very healthy happy plant at that i immediately raced to the local department store big k and purchased a new pot and rock top for it i am pleased to say she is doing very well i do recommend this company and i continue to purchase specimens from them i luv hirt is gardens enclosed photo,1
i usually just pan fry my pork and it always comes out a little dry and flavor lacking i tried these you just cover the pork with the seasonings and put them in the oven hardly any work or cleanup and the pork is nice and moist and flavorful great product,1
worth every penny kirkland makes the best products and these are amazing perfectly crunchy and salty they are incredibly fresh and last for months,1
i have had fresh coconut water in the past even though this product is not as good as the fresh ones it is comparable to it i recommend this product to anyone who doesnt have access to fresh coconut water,1
these samosa have a great flavor just enough spice to bring heat but not disrupt the good taste of the other ingredients the chutney is okay but these are fine without that addition stars simply because the price is a bit high for what you get samosa that are simply and accent to a meal not a meal in and of themselves would purchase again,1
i will agree with some others that the shipping method was a little odd but they did arrive fine not broken and quickly the best thing about these macadamias are the taste they are wonderful i just placed my second order,1
my solo apricot filling arrived this afternoon only six days after i placed my order with free shipping it is just as i remembered it from my childhood when my mother made apricot turnovers and kolacki i am thrilled that i now have a supply of twelve cans it is been increasingly hard to find in my local markets,1
use this in my morning smoothie and the quality is great i decided to use amazon is auto order for the first time and that lowered the price a bit more this seems to me to be a quality flax seed and i have not found a better price anywhere good product,1
i love is product and i would recommend this all in one popcorn packs to everyone the single packs makes popcorn for people and its all premeasured perfect popcorn every time,1
yes i did say drip i have now tried different lavazza brands this is the better of the two but do not discount the other as i love it equally i will continue to buy both as i love the occasional change up if you use this in a drip coffee pot i would suggest staring out with using just over half of the normal amount you usually use then move on from there with other brands including starbucks i would use scoops per cup so in my cup maker depending on what taste i was going after i would use up to scoops with both lavazza coffees i have found scoops is ideal in my cup maker it takes a few times to get it in your head that so much less coffee works but it does,1
dove makes great soap for the shower or even if you are merely washing your hands although i personally consider this product to be soap officially it is a beauty bar substitute for soap in that it contains a good amount of moisturizing lotion soap does not always moisturize and so dove tries to set their product apart from soap when they advertise the moisturizing abilities of their product rest assured however that you will find this item where the rest of the soap is stocked in your grocery store the bars of soap are rather large but they do not slip out of your hands too easily the shape of the bar helps you hold onto it the dove beauty bars do seem to truly help moisturize my skin when i use them to take a shower or wash my hands the scent is mild but if you are sensitive to any scent you may want to use a completely unscented type of dove soap dove is a little more expensive than other soaps but many people like me swear it is worth it my best friend uses dove religiously and he says it helps his skin a great deal one reviewer wrote elsewhere that dove soap is not particularly useful for acne but i cannot personally comment on this because i do not have acne or other types of skin breakouts i did notice however that two other people commented on that review and they stated that dove soap did help them with their acne if any skin condition is a concern for you talk with your doctor or pharmacist before using this product overall i love these dove beauty bars with their moisturizing lotion they are a bit more costly but they are worth it if you want to pamper your skin in the shower or at the bathroom vanity sink pick up a package today and give yourself a little extra pampering enjoy,1
i grew up on the blue box so if that is your taste standard look no further then this product sure if you are used to home made this probably will not compare but i actually like this better then the original kraft version as the noodles are a bit larger and stay firmer took a few minutes longer to boil growing up my mom never just served it as is but always doctored it up with extra grated cheddar cheese so i tried the same even though the cheese comes in a foil squeeze pack i added a bit of milk and a tbs of real butter then plenty of grated cheddar cheese the results was awesome and i just make this instead of the kraft brand for the whole family even though i am the celiac in the house it is so nice to stumble upon good gf substitutions and this is one i will be using regularly,1
we have had our peanut butter stirrer for probably around years now and it still works great smuckers gave them away free as a promotion for their natural peanut butter back then and we have been using it ever since i do wish it was a little longer though because it does not reach the bottom of the jar although the one in the picture looks a little less curved than mine so maybe it does now and it would be nice if it locked into the lid somehow because it can be a bit wobbly when you really get cranking but i still give it stars because it has prevented a lot of messes spilled oil is no fun and held up beautifully over the years i definitely recommend it,1
i bought this product because every cat i have owned has always had tartar problems dental cleanings are expensive and painful for cats when i first gave her a chew i had to cut it in half for her to eat it and i put the bag away in the pantry on a high shelf i left for the day and when i came home i found that somehow she would leapt to the shelf knocked the bag down and eaten about half of the chews the shelf is the same location where i keep temptations treats and she would never tried to get on the shelf before this is a great product i would give it stars if possible,1
it took me a couple of tries to really figure these out better directions would help first when you empty out your k cup don t rip out the filter it needs to stay in the cup second make sure you line the k cup up with the existing hole that eliminates leaking third i use two scoops of coffee then tap it down put the lid on delicious coffee either oz or oz of water works great i plan to purchase another set because someone threw out one of the cups and lids darn it all,1
izze has seemed to find the balance between healthy fruit taste and the sensation of carbonated soft drinks with their sparkling juice line i have not had a soft drink in over a year since discovering these wonderfully refreshing healthy alternatives to carbonated soft drinks since it is pure fruit juice it is also naturally weet but not too sweet so it also satisfies that sweet tooth as well although not a substitute for plain ol this beverage definitely satisfies and quenches my thirst ca not get enough of these beverages,1
love these really are better than coffee after lunch orange now my favorite flavor,1
kitchen bouquet is an awesome brown liquid that adds depth to sauces gravies soups and stews it is concentrated so you do not need much but add it to a slow cooker roast or stew or to a roast in the oven and you will have the family bragging about your cooking you can mix a tiny bit with butter or with a rub to put on turkey or chicken before roasting or after to add to the gravy very rich flavor without being too overpowering you are gonna love it enjoy,1
this is my favorite of the lorann oils i have so far it is delicious and great in things like oatmeal the flavor is rich and buttery and really leaves you satisfied,1
yes there is a little gritty texture but it reminds me of the texture of oatmeal cookie dough or some sort of dough where the sugar is granulated this is delicious yes some of the raisins have sunk to the bottom buy some raisins and put them on your spoon this is a good product a good company and amazon has a good price if you are unsure if you want six jars spend the extra money at the grocery store walmart even carries a couple of flavors and even some of the single serve packets and see if it is your bag it is my bag try it on some apples or pears yum,1
this devon custard is special like it very much based on one special occasion and have re ordered the four pack of this devon custard to celebrate special occasions wish it easier to get this but glad amazon makes ordering the devon custard possible to learn a little about british cooking i made a note of the ingredients on the can label as follows skimmed milk buttermilk sugar modified starch vegetable oil whey flavouring colours curcumin annatto total milk content watered down it seems less thickener necessary that way suitable for vegetarians says the label if you divide the contents into three portions the label says in each serving there are grams of milligrams of calcium grams of carbohydrate not much sugar to judge by the low calorie count and better sugar than corn sweeteners say i i plan to keep this label to learn more the british have different regulations than the united states regarding artificial colors and flavors what the united states allows the british often do not annatto and curcumin which can be looked up on the web are considered not artificial enjoyed this product keep thinking about all those wonderful custard producing british cows hopefully grazing on nice british grass in a green meadow,1
this is an excellent tasting tea one of the reasons that i purchased it was because it is naturally decaffeinated the tea was delivered quite promptly as well if you are a tea drinker i would highly recommend this,1
full flavored no nasty after taste hard to tell if is diet or not overall one of the best root beers on the market,1
i am always amazed at how well the coffees taste with the k cups i am always afraid they will taste instant but do not with the tea it was the same i was hesitant to try them out for fear they would taste different but this is a delicious smooth tea i also have the caffeinated and enjoy that just as much,1
these people produce high quality foods i have been impressed with everything i bought from them except the cheddar cheese it tastes just like kraft good if you have very young children maybe almond meal is wonderful in desserts and not easy to find it was very fresh aromatic and tasty,1
my husband and i have been eating the blood type diet way for over a year now and we do not eat white flour or gluten anymore and i really missed my pretzels so when i saw this product i thought i would give it a try and was pleasantly surprised with the taste they are a little dry of course but the overall texture and taste was very satisfying now i do not feel so deprived anymore,1
i have been using agave for a few years now and before discovering it here on amazon i would generally go with what was on sale locally i have tried several brands and most are good but this madhava light works the best for me in things like white tea or coffee where you want just the sweet with as little added flavor to it as possible this brand also tends to be easier to find locally so i can compare prices and frequently get a really good deal from the smaller to this larger size very pleased with this product and highly recommended,1
we were looking for oh henry bars as our new grandson was named henry to pass out instead of cigars good value,1
just delicious not a fruit cake at all but a very delicious european tradition that lives on you should try it we love it,1
first i eat a lot of oatmeal and i was about out and have to travel out of town to buy the kind i like in bulk so i decided to bite the bullet and give great river is a try as i have not been disappointed with any of their products my main hesitation was taking a chance on the thick rolled oats and that they would take longer to cook than i prefer worries were unfounded cup of oats cup of water some cinnamon and chopped up dates and minutes in the microwave and i had my perfect bowl of oatmeal as far as the actual oats could not be happier very aromatic and fresh right out of the bag if you like oatmeal as much as i do do not hesitate in buying these,1
purchased online when our local store quite carrying excellent noodles good price yummy even though you have to purchase a case it is worth it,1
ca not get enough of these i think they just converted my vegetarian daughter think i will have to hide them from her,1
i have been drinking oclock coffee since i was a kid it has taken me several years to find someone who sells this coffee it is the best coffee i have drank as long as amazon sells it i will continue to buy it,1
each time i have tried the crystal light appletini drink my first taste is crisp light refreshing with a color reminiscent of the green apples we all know after awhile though the sour taste became predominant for me and i was not quite so enthused i do not like sour and did not anticipate the product being made that way still for those who enjoy a sour taste the reduction of calories for this drink mix makes it a great alternative to the other flavors routinely available the package for review included quart packets with a serving it is about caloriesi think you would really have to enjoy the sour apple flavor which i personally would not normally choose i guess i could consider a sweetener lol but that would be cheating a little for purposes of the review would not it i will leave it up to you who buy drink mixes but i thought the price was high for quarts of essentially apple juice you decide,1
i love pamelas baking mix we use it all the time for my son with celiac disease he loves the pancakes but also muffins and banana bread we also use it for chocolate chip cookies and really yummy cornbread pamela is web site has some great recipes for the mix and some helpful baking hints you can substitute it for flour in your regular recipes just account for the baking powder and other ingredients that are already in the mix,1
my boys max marley and moe love these treats they get them on the weekend and i could swear they know when it is saturday morning they get beggin strips during the week and they love those two but they spin around in circles for these,1
good snack alone or as a side for salad or soup it has a different flavor from the every day cracker which i enjoyvery much,1
if you crossed an almond joy candy bar with a cookie it would taste like this i am happy that its less sweet than most cookies or candy bars i do not like overpowering sweetness instead this tastes slightly sweet with lots of nutty coconut flavor and a bit a chocolate love that its gluten free and mg of omega fatty acids it has lots of organic ingredients and is sweetened mostly with agave i only have one gripe manufactured on the same equipment with peanuts i really appreciate that they tell me i just wish they did not do it because that means its to dangerous of a product to keep in our house guess that means i need to hurry and eat them all,1
calphalon used to sell spice blends and this poultry grill and broil was a favorite spice hunter took it over and for a while i could find it at the grocery store it disappeared from the shelves a couple of years ago and i was so happy to find it on amazon this blend adds a lot of flavor to poultry without adding any salt it is great,1
bliss begins when you first pop one of these healthy goodies in your mouth the mouthfeel of the high quality dark chocolate perfectly complements the firm crunch of the soybeans the ratio of chocolate to soybeans is perfect these treats have a crisp appeal and not a heavy waxiness that i sometimes encounter with dark chocolate two clusters are enough to satiate my chocolate craving with minimal guilt,1
we have been using this stuff for our baby for three years and she loves it,1
as many cappuccino mixes i have bought over the years this one is the best it is not to sweet like all the others it just right,1
my dogs love the bacon egg cheese becca is biscuits so i decided to give these a try also they are perfect for my chihuahuas but would also be great as a training treat for larger dogs they are not insanely little like the cloudstar itty bitty buddy biscuits they measure about each and my dogs absolutely love them another great becca is product,1
this is the best coffee i have ever had and i may not be a coffee expert but i consider myself picky this is extremely smooth and flavorful i wish the price were lower we had to sign for our package that came directly from jamaica hey it is real but it is so worth the splurge,1
i am not usually one for flavored coffees save for a wonderful hazelnut brew i had at thanksgiving dinner about fifteen years ago i usually stick with darker roasts from africa central america in fact my current favorite is an organic blend from my wife is home country honduras i have however found something truly delightful in this wonderful gevalia dark chocolate truffle ground coffee this captivating coffee derived co incidentally given my taste from south central america has a thoroughly enticing aroma just the right hint of dark chocolate truffle flavor added to make me wonder if the phrase decadent indulgence should not be included on the elegant blue packaging a exceptionally pleasing cup of coffee is surely in store for anyone who gives gevalia dark chocolate truffle ground coffee a try an absolutely top drawer product that i very highly recommend,1
i was addicted to vitamin water i drink several daily which was adding more calories than i wanted i decided to try these as a replacement and i love them they are carbonated a small amount which is pleasant the fact that they have zero calories is a big plus i get them with the subscribe and save so i am saving money calories and not losing taste at all,1
i have been trying out different crackers and pretzels to fulfill my need for something nonsweet and crunchy that is not too bad for me i think manischewitz has a real shot at the non bube market even though there is no salt added these whole wheat matzos are not tasteless i think they would sell more boxes to outsiders if they shrank the image of the crackers on the box and included a simple hummus recipe on the back of the box as a serving suggestion it could not hurt,1
i tried this rum cake while i was on a crusie vacation i liked it then but wondered if it would be as good if i ordered one at home i was not disappointed it was great very moist and flavorful i would not hesitate to purchase this again i also tried the banana flavor and was not as happy with it it was good but i prefer this one,1
i will never use crisco again it fries great it is also afantastic non greasy moisturizer it is cholesterol free natural and smells great coconut oil also has lots of medical benefits google it i am sure you will love it,1
consider this an endorsement of the product it is a delicious product ideal with or more milk no skim and served in a very large bowl you can eat a lot of it i can eat a lot of it a lot of it is meant to be eaten the six pack is just as well because it is extremely difficult to find this cereal in arizona i used to feel this price was ridiculous but now after four months without clc it is most certainly fair and can be delivered overnight by air for you prime members the prime is an end in itself to have things delivered in two days for free that is a lot of products that can make their way to you it is the world is largest grocery store and bookstore everything the world in all its muchness is yours for the ordering i love all of it the world these reviews amazon and its slightly salacious campy name amazon prime the website the other reviewers who gave it five stars and their children all these things are beautiful all these things will fade away you might as well stock up because you may never be able to leave the house again,1
warning these are so addictive i first bought these in the philippines and have just recently found them again the combination of cracker and nut is outstanding it is so very tasty i would rank these in my top snacks the butter is the best flavor for me but i would love to try the bbq ones,1
i am an avid fan of this new starbuck coffee i hate the bitter dark roasts they usually sell this is coffee for real people not snobs just people who want a good cup of coffee love it,1
i love the taste of this salt as another viewer did state the black coloring of the salt does spread the salt crystals are a good size with out being over powering,1

in my family cereal is never consumed normally ie in a bowl with milk and a spoon as in a family of gamers we usually stick to the tried and true method of munching out of the box while engaging in some tedious task involving an electronic device of some kind call us primitive but the hand in box method helps us stay full all day without gorging on junk food via drive thru or conveniently placed over priced vending machines kellogg is new cinnamon flavored mini wheats certainly was consumed in the aforementioned method by myself and my house sitting brother and we came up with the following results cool truth be told they tasted like cinnamon toast crunch but in mini wheat form makes sense really as all they had to do was swap around the flavor dispensers and called it good this is not a bad thing it just is not a new and revolutionary idea like krave was something i could definitely get addicted to i enjoyed munching on them but it just is not munch food given how easily the mini wheats fall apart in my hands maybe i should try a spoon either way it just was not for me but they tasted good all the same,1
shipped as advertised and great product fair price leave more than three stars or receive follow up email,1
if you love hp sauce you probably would not be looking at buying it in bulk unless you do this is definitely the way to go it tastes as good as it ever did and seems to keep without deteriorating at all in a cool place but not necessarily refrigerated my family loves it on many savory items anything from breakfast eggs to burgers and steak and we add it to bean dishes and homemade barbeque sauce too unreservedly stars just wish we could buy lea and perrins worchestershire sauce and marmite in bulk too,1
i highly recommend the dreamfields line of pastas i would put these to a blind taste test with any and every pasta i have ever had and hands down you can not taste the difference,1
i have memories of my dad eating mallomars and i think it was my little brother is first big word as in please pass the mallomars these were just as i remembered they crumble a little if you try and take a bite instead of popping the entire cookie in your mouth the marshmellow was soft and chocolate just right i would recommend these to others,1

very tasty product that is made from wholesome grains have been drinking this for about two years yummmm,1
i can not believe how good this is i added mushrooms ground beef and a full meal was born try it,1
i can not believe something like this has not been on the market until now i downed one of these babies before an intense workout and another one after wow it does not taste sugary like some other drinks out there i have tried them all and i did not feel nearly as tired as i usually do the day aftr a workout like that i was all out of the drink a few days later when i did a similar workout and i could definitely tell the difference this drink made not only does it taste good but it also does not leave that nasty aftertaste like some other drinks do love this stuff,1
best unsalted almond ever from blue dimond i have recommemded this product to my family for healthy snack so go for it,1
this is so much better than cheesecloth i use it for nutmilks to press juice it is also very easy to clean for the juice i keep all of the ends stalks etc from making smoothies and food prep in a container in the fridge and when it gets full i blend it all in the blender and use the nut milk bag to get just the juice out of it sometimes i will add an apple to the blender too it makes for a fabulous morning with tons of extra energy i am thinking maybe i can get by without a messy and expensive juicer using this bag,1
really like these suckers they taste good and i only has one that was broken in the whole box very happy with the product i only gave it stars because they were not as big as i thought they would be but they are sucker size versus being small lollipop size,1
the only treat my fussy siamese will eat i do not mind these are actually good for her and do not upset her otherwise sensitive stomach,1
i recently discovered i have candida and have been forbidden to drink anything with caffeine sugar or gluten which cause a flare up in my symptoms my boyfriend and i went to a food co op on saturday to find things that i can eat very few traditional grocery store foods are allowed on the candida diet i noticed zevia and was pleased to find that it is sweetened with stevia one of the few sweeteners i can consume the price was a little high at a little over a dollar a can plus tax but i felt it was worth it to get my sweet fix i was tentative to try this because we had recently purchased truvia and the taste right out of the jar was slightly bitter but with my first sip of the ginger root beer i loved it it is very bubbly and light and refreshing not bitter at all it does not weigh you down or coat your teeth with a sugar film like normal sodas either and the ginger root beer taste is different than any other soda too all that said zevia is ginger root beer makes a perfect substitute to regular root beer if i could eat ice cream or have alcohol i bet it would be wonderful in a root beer float or mixed with blackberry brandy my favorite i highly recommend at least giving this soda a try i have not tried any other varieties yet but i can personally attest to the wonderful flavor of the ginger root beer and anyone who is looking for a healthy soda option should consider zevia,1
this is the second time i have ordered the monsooned malabar coffee from coffe bean direct and it is very nice full flavored coffee deliveries are timely and everything i expect and more,1
i was pleasantly surprised by this product and it is usefulness to do the job most is do not do what they say they are going to do especially in terms of the moisture factor but after using the product and drying my hair there was actually a pleasant sheen to my hair strands and to top it off the smell was refreshingly delicious plus you can not beat the cost very worth it highly recommended,1
i love these fat free brownies my yr old daughter watches her figure and is a healthier eater with a sweet once in a while yet is picky and loves them and my yr old son is a junk food junkie and will not eat anything that he thinks is diet or has something in it that does not sound good and he saw they i added yogurt yet he raves about these brownies and they are excited whenever i make them i love them because they help my chocolate craving and keep me on trake with weight watchers i have lost lbs so far yeaaaaah michelle from mi,1
these taste wonderful the only reason i gave them stars is that they are addicting ca not eat just one although a much better alternative than a box of chocolates highly recommend,1
i love the taste of this i started drinking a glass of milk before bed which helps with my insomnia and the malt powder makes it taste so much better it is true that it does not dissolve well but using a spoon for the lumps at the bottom of the glass it is like dessert like malt balls without the chocolate if you put the powder in the glass first with just a tiny bit of milk and make a paste before you add the rest of the milk it works better but like i said i do not mind the lumps i suppose a blender would be the ticket if you want a smooth drink i do not know why more stores do not carry it,1
this will double as an indelible dye do not spill it on anything you want to wear in company but i am crazy over it of course after i mix up a batch i add at least an ounce each of lemon juice lime juice it takes that to bring out the most refreshing quality counteract the sickening sweetness that most americans other than me apparently crave i keep a jug of it in the refrigerator at all times it is rare a day will pass that i do not have a glass or or stores around here stopped carrying it as they do with anything that i really like except for safeway which hit me up for a cannister for it i was delighted to find it here i signed on for auto delivery because the price is so reasonable i just gotta have it,1
i do very much enjoy victorian inn instant cappuccino they have the best creamy coffees going today as far as i am concerned i will probably not purchase them through amazon again however amazon makes promises they do not keep i was promised free shipping however they broke the order into enough pieces that i wound up paying three different times for shipping i will find my products elsewhere,1

why is it so hard to find unfrosted plain pop tarts in stores nowadays is everybody so sugar addicted that they have to have their processed cardboard covered in a hardened glaze of frosting actually unfrosted pop tarts can be made much more delicious and even more non nutritious if you toast them in a toaster oven slathered with butter so that it sinks down into the tiny holes on top yum truth be told my husband must have pop tarts for breakfast period at least on amazon they can be found in the traditional unfrosted form so we became subscribers keep those plain fruit filled treats coming i am still waiting to see my husband dance for joy like the cartoon kids on the tv commercial but so far nothing yet,1
bags are sturdy enough for task and i like that they are biodegradable i have used these for a few years for my shepherd and lab,1

these protein bars are a perfectly healthy treat i love that i do not have to feel guilty when i grab one of these these fit right into the metabolic effect diet,1
since my sister is a diabetic we try things that say free of flour good fiber and good taste this product fills the bill as long as you serve with a flavorful sauce and veggies plus meat of choice it does have a better mouth feel if cooked slightly longer and was great as leftovers after sitting in the sauce i have made the soup with these noodles too and it was very good as long as the broth carried the flavor,1
best ramen noodles i ever ate i will be eating plenty of these as they are only calories per package and make for an excellent snack i like dropping a jumbo egg additional calories with good protein in for a poached egg effect as it gets close to the minute boiling finish i will look forward to trying other indomie flavors and products in the future,1
first off this stuff tastes great i wish i could drink it all the time but if i did i would be in the bathroom more often than not this stuff works better than any pill or suppository that i have ever tried and unfortunately i have tried more than my share,1
after using wiltons markers which dry out quickly and do not give a smooth line i decided to try these these markers are great they give a smooth line as well as a thin line i will purchase these from now on,1
i absolutely love these things you do get what you pay for on this one but they cost a little more than going the cheap route i set two cans out for a meeting and people practically wanted me to be local suppleir there is a down side to these though there is no kissing momma or poppi after eating them there are delicious but your breath will not be helped witha simple mint when i retire i want to be the sales rep for mauna loa so i get free samples,1

this is a highly unusual tea real licorice root blended with other spices i have been buying this for ten years and absolutely love it it is somewhat sweet and densely flavored very rich makes a nice dessert drink or afternoon pick me up,1
for instant food the quality of the sauce is pleasantly surprising it is spicier than i would expect the box says mild but it is not overwhelming and has lots of flavor the pieces of paneer are smaller than what is shown on the box and not as good as what you would get in a restaurant i do not know how this brand holds up to the other instant brands so i can not make that kind of comparison it was tasty enough for me to want to try other mtr dishes in the future overall it is a very tasty quick dish i used the microwave method instead of boiling the pouch in water,1
i recieved a free sample bag in the mail yesterday immediately ate them all up both servings these veggie krinkle sticks are amazing they kind of remind me of the hot fries i used to get in high school without the hotness love the texture the flavor there is plenty of both so you will definitely be satisfied probably crave more these lesser evil snacks are far superior to other veggie chips i have purchased,1

the breeder that i bought my english bulldog puppy was top notch they had a lot of money invested in their breeding operation and it was easily noticeable i saw this brand food chicken and rice formula stacked up high and asked why this brand and where could i get it she said that her and her husband researched dog food for six months and this is what they decided on said they got it from amazon but maybe there are other locations locally wherever you are my dog loves it and she is very healthy with a beautiful coat,1

saw this package advertised on sam adams website with a discount and decided to give robinsons prime reserve a try instead of omaha steaks i do not know where this cut of steak is supposed to rate as far as being a prime cut but it is really good the other offerings on the robinson website are pricey but judging by the quality of these steaks i am going to take the plunge also this package comes with sam adams pint glasses but i received the wrong glasses one simple e mail through amazons customer service and robinson apologized for the mix up and sent me glasses for the inconvenience,1

my dad introduced us to skinner is years ago we are now three generations and extended family fans of this cereal we have some dissenters in the family and i am controversial because i prefer my skinner is after it sits in the milk for a while as that allows all the flavor to emerge from the cereal one look at the nutritional value of skinner is versus post or kellogg is on the basis of sodium skinner is very low and fiber skinner is very high will tell you to give this a try i admit the taste is maybe not for everybody as it is not sweet but i have always found it to have a raisin in every bite and we enjoy it we all add a banana berries or other fruit to make it a wonderful breakfast my family orders it in bulk because no stores sel it in our area thanks to attune for remarketing this great cereal,1
clothing moths are almost impossible to get rid of we bought an antique rug and it was infested unbeknownst to us without noticing the moths infested our house and sweater drawers horrible i called bug companies but i had more knowledge than the guys who wanted to come out here and spray for them i did not want the chemicals in my house and spraying is ineffective per what i had read on the internet the safer good name hormone tents did the trick however as it says it lures the guys into the sticky trap the females are left in the cold ha and die without making eggs it is the eggs in the sweaters that turn to larvae the larvae eat the clothes not the moths the larvae eat the clothes in order to eradicate the moths you need to continue to use the tents i am on my fourth round over a long period of time to make sure you catch all the males my tents are out for three months then i buy new ones and repeat my last round had no moths caught i am still going to do it one more time during the process you know where the moths tend to be more prevalent by the number caught in each trap so i put more there for instance under the chairs in the living room etc also do not scrimp on your first purchase you need a ton of them to figure out where the problem is do it right lots or you will not have a blueprint of where to put the next batch and you might be missing a room that is where the most are etc etc etc yes it is an investment but it works and much cheaper than the cashmere sweaters that were wrecked because of the holes sigh and cheaper than the useless companies who want to spray for the moths and just so you know the moths do not just go away they get worse which i learned the hard way,1
i love this tea it is delicate i do not care for overbearing spice or overbearing ginger and this tea cannot be called overbearing in any way it is lovely addictive and i have not been able to find it at any local brick and mortar stores so yummy,1
i really like granola and have tried many different kinds most of them are just too sweet more like candy than a nutritious treat with grains and fruit these are perfect i like the fruit and nut it has big whole nuts so big in fact i have to pick them out before giving them to my two year old great niece that i watch my husband prefers the peak protien which has very little fruit because he does not like dried fruit those are the only two i have tried but plan on trying them all,1

this is definitely the best root beer i have ever tasted unlike some other beverages that are flavored with honey you can actually taste it in this it has a nice bite not too harsh and the after taste is smooth and sweet that being said i would not pay more than for this and that would really be pushing it for a soda you were drinking at home i could see paying a premium at a restaurant for a pack is ridiculous current advertised price they sell packs at my local grocery store for less than if you can get it at a reasonable price it is definitely recommended,1
love this tea and i can not find it in the stores anymore excellent price too,1
i have not only tried nearly all of bear naked is products but many other brands as well and this granola is the jackpot i now order it on amazon b c it is the cheapest i can find yes you get six bags but if you like anything related to granola or oats you will finish all bags within a month or two making it a great subscribe and save item,1
love the moist coconut center the chocolate is right amount of sweet too but if you prefer a stronger taste try bounty with dark chocolate it is virtually unavailable in the us so i am glad that i could keep my bounty addiction going through amazon,1
i bought this case of soup because it is getting to be cold season and i figured i would be prepared for it my family has already devoured many of the cans so i will probably have to reorder before the first round of colds hits everyone agreed that the soup had a wonderful flavor and aroma hubby says it goes great with oyster crackers only my year old complained that if you call it chicken soup there needs to be more chicken i thought it was just right though and let is face it he is a teen and can never get full,1

summarythe city roast is a medium to moderately dark roast rich coffee which i would grade as a typical american coffee being c i drink my coffee strong and city roast makes a good strong cup it is full flavored without being bitter unlike darker roasts it is not glazed with sugar which melts and sticks like a turd in your coffee grinder in short it is not the very best coffee i have drank but a very good coffee and the best combination of quality and value that i have found normally a coffee called city roast would not have caught my attention and i would avoid anything called supremo but the city roast was included with the sampler i purchased coffee servicesthe great advantage of coffee bean direct and other services such as boca java highly recommended and gevalia is that you are assured of fresh beans whereas you never know how long coffee has been setting on a grocery shelf or in a warehouse fresh beans make a huge difference of course that means that if you buy bags for home use you need to refrigerate it and keep it tightly sealed other recommendationsi have been using the mellita system for about years which i strongly recommend pure stevia is the sweetener in the more common truvia but without the fillers which alter the taste and leave a yucky residue in your cup as an extra bonus pure stevia is much more economical,1
the bottle recommends drops but honestly just drops in my coffee or tea is perfect no calories sweet natural great vanilla taste,1
this was one of the first foods for my son who is now months it is easy to eat as it dissolves in their mouths perfect for those without teeth it is also easy to digest basically rice and sugar for me they taste kind of like a giant rice krispie,1
just on a whim i thought i would try this and it seems to work it has several b vitamins in it and that might be the reason even if it is only psychological i do not feel as tired after drinking it best yet it is delicious,1
this good maple syrup in medium amber the most popular grade it is from vermont which has slightly more stringent standards about maple syrup density thus i was surprised that this highland sugarworks syrup was weaker than the l l bean syrup i was about to run out of but reading the label provides a clue to my disappointment it is labeled pure new england maple syrup as opposed to pure vermont maple syrup the reverse of the label says we also purchase syrup from our friends and neighbors the l l bean container says packed in vermont so i conclude that this is rated on the weaker u s scale rather than the vermont scale it is still good syrup it just seems a bit watered down compared to what i expected,1
for years i could not really drink coffee without suffering some kind of upset stomach be it cramps nausea what have you i discovered the bean at coachella this past april and i have to say that this is a coffee saver for me the low acid antioxidant mix is exactly what i needed i can now enjoy coffee again without the nasty stomach side effects if you have ever suffered from the same symptoms due to coffee you might want to try this brand the hawaiian hazelnut is precisely the blend i usually drink so i am thrilled that the bean has introduced it i highly recommend it,1
i first found watkins vanilla double strength at a farmer is market street fair many years ago i have not used anything else since watkins has a depth of flavor that enhances everything you cook if you love the taste of vanilla try this product you will not be disappointed,1

i ordered the french vanilla cappuccino and it is the best i will never buy any other cappuccino i love tim hortons french vanilla and im telling you this is just as good if not better highly recommend it,1
these folks really know how to make great food my older dog who is a picky eater was skin and bones before we switched food now she is again healthy and happy amazingly changing to natural cured dry itchy skin and lackluster fur her coat shines and she no longer scratches and chews at herself she does eat more than the recommended portions so it is a bit more expensive than expected but soooo worth the price as an aside the amount of waste that comes out in the end is about of what it used to be it also is not smelly or gross it makes clean up way faster and easier this may not seem like a big deal to some but keeping the yard clean and odor free is pretty great and having very little to pick up on walks is really nice,1
newman is own organics dark chocolate bar is a tasty fairly creamy chocolate bar one bite will satisfy your mid afternoon chocolate craving and hopefully help you make it through the rest of the day of course any bite of chocolate around that time would probably do the same so why choose this one its socially responsible the cocoa beans are grown on rainforest certified farms from their website the rainforest alliance certified tm seal guarantees that the cocoa in our signature series was grown on farms that meet comprehensive standards for sustainable farming protecting soil waterways and wildlife habitat as well as the rights and welfare of workers their families and communities its organic newman is own is certified by oregon tilth if organic foods are important to you oregon tilth certification is your guarantee that high standards have been met its simple organic evaporated cane juice organic chocolate liquor organic cocoa butter organic soy lecithin and organic vanilla its yummy cocoa means its intensely chocolatey there is a hint of sweetness but it retains the bitterness dark chocolate fans like not too creamy not too dry compared to a few other dark chocolate bars newman is own stands up pretty well i did a little taste test with the following was almost indistinguishable from newman is own same texture and very similar flavor perhaps slightly more intense trader joe is fair trade swiss dark chocolate had cocoa so it had a drier texture i even tried one by ikea which was inexpensive and chocolatey but actually my least favorite it did not appear to be fair trade or organic overall a good solid organic fair trade dark chocolate bar dark chocolate fans will like it milk chocolate fans might be converted,1
this vanilla is a large one quart bottle of quality product for the cost compared to the small containers found at the local grocery stores it is a great product that will go a long way for your baked goods happy cooking,1

we have replaced canned tomato sauce in all of our favorite recipes with these ravishing red beauties from italy and we are never going back aside from being peeled and then pasteurized in the can these san marzano plum tomatoes are just about as fresh as when they were plucked off the vine in the campania region of italy that means they are not cooked until you cook them and what a difference that makes especially with sauces simmered all day in a slow cooker or thrown together on the spur of the moment in a pressure cooker amazon com is free super saver shipping makes them a bargain compared to ordinary canned tomatoes and a steal versus the price of san marzano tomatoes from the store,1
i love this dog food i was looking for something that was higher is protein to help my dogs fur and one that had higher quality ingredients with no by products this works well for my dogs maltese yorkie mis and a maltese poodle mix i had read reviews that higher protein was not good for smaller dogs so i called my vet and was assured that it would be good for them my morkie has always had stinky breath but i have noticed a slight increase in it but that is taken care of mostly with teeth brushing and puppy breath strips my maltipoo is breath is unaffected and fine the only downside to the food is the cost and being able to find it we currently order it online but are trying to get a local private pet store to carry it,1
tastes just like carbonara sauce in spain excellent taste and easy great alternative to alfredo sauce,1
i was so happy that someone chose to sell this favorite kuhne salata seasoned vinegar dressing at amazon online my husband and i were once stationed in germany with the u s army we tried this wonderful dressing while there upon returning to the u s a i could not find it anywhere except at our military commissary and quickly bought two bottles that was many many years ago and we are not near a military base where we live right now a dear neighbor in another state who is the german wife of a deceased retired military soldier went to her commissary to find it for me and then sent me two bottles of a different brand of german vinegar dressing after not being able to find my kuhne salata it was not my favored kuhne salata although i did not tell her that it was not not wanting to hurt her feelings so it was after that delivery that i went on the internet to find my kuhne salata and this amazon seller actually had it for sale at a very reasonable price even the delivery was ahead of the predicted time arriving faster than expected since it was a glass bottle he or she did an excellent job packing it and a tag was attached saying fragile would definitely recommend this amazon seller sincerely a very satisfied customer five stars,1
i really like these as they are not over roasted which destroys the rather they are tender i e not rock hard but just crunchy the flavor is wonderfully natural and refreshing and not drowned in salt or tamari sauce as the ones in the store are they do not hurt my teeth like the hard ones in the stores do i do not think that there is a better product and it is organic the right sized packs mean you will not overeat i like to enjoy about nuts with a couple of pieces of dark chocolate for desert every night i never get tired of it and it stems my appetite for the evening while providing antioxidants and essential oils also almonds are said to be the only alkaline nut i think dr weil says that you should have a handful of nuts every day and almonds are about the healthiest nut i have heard i also happen to like these,1
manuka honey is a great product the order was processed and delivered in a timely fashion i will definitely order again,1
bisquick is the best baking mix on the market and provides a good start for pancakes and crepes i like the ounce units because you do not end up with extra batter this size is perfect for our family of on what kind of consistency you prefer you can add more or less milk and another egg to the mix if you like i like my pancakes more crepe like but my daughter likes hers to be fluffier with this mix i can make hers first with a heavier batter and then add more milk to the leftover mix and make my crepes we actually do not use this mix for biscuits but just for pancakes and crepes as we are not really biscuit eaters amazons price is of course just right for this product i feel good just knowing i have a case in my pantry,1
the z bones dental chews are great i was looking for a dental chew that both of my dogs would like in addition to being a healthy and effective chew i have a sheltie and a chihuahua they make a funny couple and while they are not super chewers like labs they do like to chew including the chihuahua surprisingly well both dogs loved these chews they liked the smell and could not wait for me to open the re sealable plastic bag which was inside the box keeping them fresh both dogs got right down to chewing the bones and the sheltie finished his in one sitting while the chihuahua almost did even the piece of the z bone that was left about a was finished by the chihuahua in a couple of days it was also nice that the z bone lasted quite a while for both dogs rather than disappearing in just a few minutes i just thought i would share my experience with other dog owners since i have appreciated the feedback provided by others on different products which has resulted in great purchases helping me to avoid poor choices and saving me money thanks,1
these taste very good but the ginger flavor was too weak i want more intense and full bodied flavor especially considering how expensive this is i will not be purchasing again unless it is per bag i am on a budget and would rather save money for real ginger,1
great item but you can get this same box at costco for highly recommend these though better than greasy potaoe chips anyday,1
great product great price for the product quick ship and the is a good amount,1
i am serious with every bite you think it is wonderful because you totally convince yourself it is loaded with protein i have never had anything taste so great the one bad thing is of course you can say i will just have one more and you can not they are so reasonable on amazon and if you have prime shipping you can have them in days,1
apple jacks where can you go wrong my kids and husband love them even my toddler asks for them for breakfast,1
i have been experimenting with homemade sugar free chocolate for a while now and after trying a large number of sugar substitutes i have found it very difficult to make anything that i am proud of chocolate in general is very temperamental it has six different crystalline forms and you have to get the temperature just right or else you wind up with a less than desirable form and your sugar substitute needs to be fat soluble and anhydrous because small amounts of water can will cause your chocolate to seize it is very complicated and i have never been keen on anything i have made myself coco polo is chocolate by contrast is tempered perfectly it has just the right snap and mouth feel because it is flavored with stevia and erythritol the easiest on your stomach sugar alcohol you can eat the whole bar in one sitting and not suffer any unpleasant effects at least i did not everyone is different but i can say that even small amounts of malitol sweetened chocolate cause me gastric upset that being said this product is not as sweet as ordinary sugared chocolate but that is going to be true of any sugar free chocolate in particular coco polo is sweetness is also somehow more subtle which is the best i can explain it if your familiar with stevia as a sweetener in tea and coffee you will know what i am talking about it is not as intense as sugar but it is still nice and does not have any chemical aftertaste if you are a fan of less sweet dark style chocolates than transitioning to this sugar free band is easy if i did not know any better i would give this product or stars because it is not as good as regular chocolate but having tried to make my own for years i recognize when i have been outdone and i am giving it a star review i have also tried many brands of sugar free chocolate over the years and i like this one the best on the downside i think this chocolate is too pricey when i ordered mine it was shipped in an insulated container with cold packs to keep it stable this was in the spring and early fall perhaps in the winter they forgo this treatment they do not ship at all in the heat of summer so perhaps the extra cost is to cover the special shipping,1
as the espresso roast blend is the one starbucks stores use to base their drinks on including cappuccinos frappuccinos and all other creations that customers demand on a daily basis this coffee is addictive and has a heady aroma and its caramelly sweetness comes through cup after cup and it is the perfect blend for a new coffee drinker to try it is worth every penny and starbucks would not pull a shot without it i even brew it straight up in my bunn coffeepot for a nice rich pot of java that makes my morning a little more bearable,1
great mix for the belgium waffle maker that i bought from amazon i make one for my son in the a m and save the remainder of the batter in the refrigerator for the next a m the recipe is quick and very yummy,1
if you like aji amarillo this will not disappoint it is the real deal if you are looking for a new flavor to liven up your cuisine that adds flavor and heat give this a try i love aji amarillo and always like knowing i have got some on the shelf for me it comes down to availability and price and since local sources are sporadic the latin products through amazon com is the option i can count on when i am down to three jars i will order another dozen i love aji and love the fact i do not have to constantly search and check local mercados for my favorite condiment,1
i am a vegetarian and i feel bad that i never have any real meat to give to my animals as treats they get so excited whenever others bring chicken or turkey into the house my cats love these treats the only ingredient is natural usda inspected chicken breast so i feel good about them eating these they are marketed for dogs but they break up really easy into cat sized pieces,1
i am always looking for a good breakfast cereal and there are so many on the market now that are both delicious and nutritious that it is hard to choose this one i had trouble keeping away from my and year old daughters so that i could review it it is not too high in sugar and calories and contains a pretty good amount of fiber two of the key things i look for in addition to taste my only knock against the cereal is the same as all of these cereals with bits of nuts attached to the cereal the nuts are too small to really have any texture left and there is not enough of them to really taste if the box had not said there were nuts in there i would have never known i prefer cereals with whole nuts or at least slivers of nuts,1
my bichons and my mom is pomeranians love these and i love them because they are healthy for them no preservatives no by products all natural and made in the usa however i have found them cheaper at marshalls,1
these are some very tasty and sweet crackers they are a bit hard not overly processed like some of the big brand crackers you find in the grocery store they are very tasty and and make a great snack i have not had a chance to make smoores with them but i suspect they will be great for that too they are well formed and do not crumble apart easily so they are very versatile,1

a friend recommended these brothers crisps and i am very pleased that we took her advice being a type diabetic and trying to watch my carbs and calories these are good snacks that satisfy my sweet tooth cravings without overly spiking up my blood sugar levels the real test with any good for you snacks is if my teens will eat them and they also love them these are made from real fruit and nothing else that has been sliced and freeze dried making them crispy exactly like astronaut ice cream but they will reconstitute in your mouth if you leave them in long enough this process also makes them very flavorful this variety pack has an assortment of different types fuji apple strawberry banana and asian pear fuji apple about apples per net carbs from sugar strawberry banana about banana and strawberries per net carbs from sugar asian pear about pears per net carbs from sugar i like the asian pears the best but all of the flavors are really good the strawberries can be a little tart which is different and not displeasing to me these are a good tasting healthy snack alternative that if it was not for the fairly high cost i would keep on hand all of the time highly recommended note these are made in chinacfh,1
the paris bistro is my favorite flavor for senseo it is a nice mild flavor that does well for a late afternoon pickemup i have enjoyed senseo in europe for years on my visits there and waited till finally it was available here i get my regular douwe egberts coffee at a local european deli only one in the dallas ft worth metroplex that carries it henks i think americans expect stronger flavors in their coffee than the europeans this is mildly flavored just the right touch,1

i looooooove arctic zero and spend an insane amount of money on them i tried their new flavor cookies and cream and while it is good it tastes more like a protein mix than ice cream my favorites in order are pb chocolate mint chocolate cookie vanilla maple chocolate iwould not recommend the strawberry banana would try again if the make it just strawberry,1
i cannot get enough of this stuff i have this stuff in my kitchen all the time to me it is the best granola cereal out there,1
these are the best ginger snaps i have ever tasted the ginger taste is intense but not over powering i like that they added little pieces of candied ginger to the cookie it is a nice touch i appreciate that the ingredients are ones i can actually pronounce there are no ingredients in this cookie that make me wonder what i am eating these are all ingredients that one would use baking cookies in their own home the cookies are approximately and inch in size and there are approximately cookies in the ounce bag the bag comes with a resealable tape so you can close the bag up tight to preserve the freshness and snap of these delightful little cookies the cookies are very crunchy but not break your teeth hard like some ginger snaps can be they have the perfect density for a ginger snap i highly recommend these ginger snaps and i myself will be buying more of them,1
my husband and i recently went primal after seeing wonderful results from our daughter who brought us a jar of nutiva coconut manna yesterday i just had my first spoonful and it was love at first bite i have not had refined sugar grains or processed foods of any kind for weeks now and this was a wonderful sweet treat that was almost decadent it was filling and satisfying and will certainly be included as permanent staple in our pantry going forward i am wondering if the folks who felt that it was not sweet are eating sugar i feel that once you detox from refined sugars your taste buds are heightened and you can truly appreciate this great product,1
these flavors work perfectly with wilton candy melts i used them to flavor a wide variety of chocolate and candy melt creations the flavors taste natural and are strong enough to require very little per batch,1

i have tried a good amount of granola bars in my time i usually use various granola bars when doing everything from backpacking to snowbarding for hours to simple snacks throughout the day to full meals at times being a huge fan of both dark chocolate and coffee this natural bar from kashi is a great snack at any time of the day quality ingredients and a reasonable price is great for what you get out of these bars the chewy texture is great when you bite into an occasional almond and there isnt too much dark chocolate bits but just enough to go well with the mocha flavor i usually eat one with my coffee in the morning while at the office when i am short on time or in the evening when i dont want a big meal but want something reasonably healthy the bars are great when short on time and need a quick pick me up i use them with some juice in the morning when just waking and going for a spin class easy on the stomach at least for me great buy,1
i have been eating these oatmeal pies now for years really no kidding mom used to put them in our lunch boxes and we just loved squeezing them a bit to mash them down before we opened these delectable treasures they really have not changed that much over the years they are just significantly smaller now than they used to be in the they were the favorites of the house then and they are the favorites now i can not ever keep a box of these guys around very long they just disappear without warning i particularly like the fact that they have not made the filling taste waxy like so many other favorites have over the years great great cookie pie perfect for lunch boxes highly highly highly recommend,1
the price was amazing and the shipping was the faster than i expected i was very pleased,1

i am a hypoglycemic and have recently decided to respect my body is need for very low amounts of sugar so that i do not end up as a diabetic before beginning this new lifestyle my creature comforts were mints gum but because almost all of them are made with sugar sugar alternative that raise insulin i thought i had to give them up completely xylitol does not require insulin to metabolize so this gum is a god sent i love having multiple packs at once i keep one in my purse one at the office any time i need a breath freshner or a sweet treat i pop in my mouth i am good to go i am so glad this gum exists,1
i am not a huge fan of convenience foods so prefer to cook from scratch when possible but sometimes when you are on the go it is helpful to have a few items that you can throw together at a moment is notice of all the pre packaged potato mixes i think this one is the best my kids love these julienne potatoes,1
i already knew what to expect when it came to taste my family loves the thick creamy just sweet enough silk almond vanilla but when it comes to ordering i feel like i was tricked a little hence the stars rather than the picture implies that you would receive a half gallon size whereas when you read you see that it says cartons quart size i did not read when i ordered i was in a rush and after receiving my package quite timely i might add i was a little confused i had to go back and look at it and read so the picture does not match the product you will receive just be aware otherwise it is just as perfect a product as you could ask for,1

i am on the wagon this holiday season but i do like a good cocktail enter crystal light is mocktail appletini i must say i was not prepared for the refreshing taste of this drink and the score of five calories per serving is an extra bonus how do they fit something so appley sweet and zingy into just five cals i would describe it as liquid apple green synthetic nectar in a glass yum,1

first things first the cinnamon almond eat think smile granola clusters taste great an honest cocoa flavor crunchy and tasty too many health snacks fail that test within one or two bites this stuff is good now to the more complicated stuff after discarding the or of healthy snack foods who is flavor does not agree with me i then run into conflict with the reality of the nutrition label you know what i mean only calories per serving then you note that there are servings in the package sound the alarm at first i was a little leery on this count a ounce bag of granola clusters contains calories per serving not outrageous but a piece of math that instantly worries me especially when the product tastes so good did i mention that it tastes real good this is where i give these guys stars what looked to me as being a of the package actually satisfies usually something this tasty suffers the ignominy of getting cleaned out in one setting leaving me disappointed and weighing a pound or two more the following morning not the case here a little goes a long way toward leaving you satisfied i have never had this to say about a snack food product before this is the first snack food that meets all of my expectations no trade offs great taste great texture natural healthy ingredients and a satisfying snack thank you guys,1

okay so they are not restaurant quality ravioli taste wise what out of a can is but if you compare them to other canned pasta products these are just as good and they are organic which means no fields were sprayed with petroleum based poisons that is what chemical pesticides are after all or watershed harming petroleum based chemical fertilizers google gulf of mexico dead zone and you will see what i am talking about i like to keep these around for those times when you need something quick and easy for more flavor it is simple to doctor them with a dash of parmesan cheese and a pinch of basil fresh if it is in season and then you have got a nice tasty vegetarian meal,1

who would have guessed that my picky eater would love this cat food i bought a few cans while i was on vacation earlier this summer now he complains if i serve him anything else he really seems to like the combination of tuna and chicken with a chicken broth jelly on top i like it because i can open a fresh ounce can for each feeding rather than putting the rest of a bigger once can in the refrigerator for later where it often gets stale under a snap on lid besides my cat hates cold food if your feline also is a picky eater give this cat food a try in addition i like the convenience of ordering through amazon because my local stores do not carry this cat food,1

this silver collectors edition is really cool you get a bullet which actually twists open to reveal a tiny little spoon to eat the sauce with and good thing it is micro sized because anymore than that well your basically screwed being the chilli head i am i took one of those little egg spoons and filled that up that would be a fairly good finger tip amount way more than the spoon they give you i ate it licked the spoon clean and whoa great balls of fire after a few min it got even hotter and i felt dizzy and my ears hurt a little what a rush that was my stomach killed me later so i will never do anything like that amount ever again well maybe lol this sauce is worth the money the taste ai not too bad either for a powerful extract sauce but what is to really taste it just one big burn,1

my kids love the classic kraft mac and cheese so i thought i would see if they liked this of course they did not because it is different from their norm why break something that is not broken however my dad loved it this mac n cheese has more seasonings which my dad loved and thought was a pleasant surprise he loves hearty meals so the classic mac does not do it for him it was very easy to make just like any other hamburger helper or kraft boxed meal,1
i bought this from a local eatery on lunch today and it really is not that bad if you cannot get past the color difference i would not recommend buying it there is a very slight metallic aftertaste which one might expect if something has over trace minerals and electrolytes in it and does not contain any additives to hide these things one post said it was greasy or thick that person was not drinking blk maybe they poured themselves a cup of motor oil and are mistaken obviously if allow your mind to play tricks on you this item will not be very enjoyable as you will associate the color with other things of this color ahem motor oil but if you can get past the mental part of it i think it is worth a shot the price however is a bit outrageous,1
nantucket blend by green mountain is my husbands favorite blend in k cups i have searched the net and it so easy to order on amazon and the price is comparable or lowerthan other sites since it is the only brand he enjoys in k cups the larger quantityof means more time between reorders i only wish this would be set up on the autoship program for additional savings and never having to worry about running out,1

the best most delicious and totally consistant pumpkin pies are made from libby is pure pumpkin a single oz can makes one deep dish pie cup volume or two shallow pies cup volume if you are making two deep dish pies buy the oz can which is far more economical this is what comes in the can pure pumpkin which can also be called pumpkin puree or solid pack pumpkin nothing else so salt no preservatives the pumpkin is cooked during the canning process so you could eat it straight from the can should you so desire the pumpkin pie recipe is on the back of the can i have tried other fancier more complicated recipies over the years but have always come back to the tried and true because to me this is what pumpkin pie is supposed to taste like you get a fragrant and flavorful pie with an excellent texture the recipe calls for sugar evaporated milk eggs cinnamon ground cloves ground ginger and salt i add tsp ground nutmeg and a dash of white pepper also i like to slightly froth the eggs because it gives the filling a smoother and more delicate texture the recipe calls for baking the pie minutes at and then minutes at i cover the crust with foil for the first minutes to keep it from getting too brown also i find that minutes at is more than enough do not overbake if a knife comes out clean from the center of the pie its done on average this oz can should be about two dollars and fifty cents at a supermarket one last thing if you remove the label from the can you will find other recipies and helpful tips printed on the other side its a total win win,1

a friend brought over a bottle as a gift and i loved it enough to hop on and write a review i am just arm chairing this but i would put it at somewhere in the range of scovilles or somewhere around half the heat of pure cap or mad dog with bullet i tested the three side by side with a dab on the finger dubious of the claim maybe they mean it was made with million extract before diluted with the vinegar the thing with all those superhots is that after a point it really does not matter they do not have flavor and you can always just add in a few extra drops i still appreciate the novelty either way it is aggressively priced nice and hot and unlike the other two sauces i have mentioned has a bit of flavor from the peppers and vinegar besides being simply being ispicy oil i like it this is certainly going to become one of my regularly stocked hot sauces it would go really well in a bit of soup pasta mashed potatoes pizza chicken wings and so forth,1

friends from tahiti rave all the time about tahitian vanilla they have given us some and i will admit it was pretty good then we brought home mexican traditional blended vanilla from a vacation to the yucatan we fell in love with it and started baking significantly more than we ever have in the past we started looking exclusively for recipes that included vanilla and the more the better since that first purchase we always came home from dive trips to cozumel and the yucatan with bottles of the stuff to use and give to family and friends the vanilla flavor of the vanilla vanillin blend is superb and oh so vanilla satisfying in everything you bake we have not made it back to mexico in three years or so and recently ran out of our previous stock of traditional blend we used the higher alcohol tahitian pure vanilla for baking recently but the flavor is noticeably different with no mexican trips on the schedule we thought we would give molina mexican vanilla blend a try from amazon it arrived we opened it and it is absolutely the vanilla vanillin blend we love as i type we have a ricotta mascarpone vanilla custard baking in the oven and the aroma of vanilla filling the house is wonderful i understand that many folks only use pure vanilla that is great but if pure is not that important to you and you just want incredible vanilla flavor give molina mexican vanilla blend a try,1
i really enjoyed this banana nut bread bar from quaker oats i put mine in the microwave for seconds and it was nice warm and soft it smells like fresh baked banana bread when you heat it in the microwave it has a nice banana packed flavor to it and the crunchy nuts on the top are the icing on the cake it does not have the consistency of banana bread but for a healthier alternative i will take it i need to pick a box of these up to have on hand,1

what a delicious treat my husband and i both loved these they are sweet but not too sweet great cinnamon flavor moist crust dough these are great as a dessert as a compliment to coffee latte or whatever they were delivered quickly and so far have stayed fresh for at least a week actually we ate this bag within a couple days but i still have some other items from this seller and they are still fresh after over a week i am not sure how long they stay fresh after delivery but suspect they could also be frozen i am going to order other flavors and try them too we also had the vanilla ones and i loved them though my husband still prefers the cinnamon,1

i am so glad i found this online so i do not have to pay a drink at the coffee shop this is my favorite drink,1
my wife and i love indian food i prefer the hotter the better but she prefers mild with rich flavors the tiger tiger products fall right in the middle as an excellent compromise we have tried the chana masala mutter paneer and veggie korma all with excellent luck but with a word of advice if you think of these products as complete meals as they are advertised you will be pleased but not blown away however if you think of them as an excellent place to start then the possibilities are endless with the chana masala we usually add another can of chick peas and some cilatro or other herb that cooks well then we just let it simmer on the stove top for minutes with very little supervision and medium low heat you will not have any concerns over burning and like many saucy foods it just gets better with time they give this a spice rating but it is not hot in any sense of the word i usually add a little chili oil to my serving to punch it up because it adds hot without affecting the flavors the mutter paneer is excellent as is and the only thing we have found that we like to add is a very healthy dose of chopped fresh spinach spinach is already one of the ingredients so we just put the tiger tiger sauce in a pan and add about oz of fresh spinach it takes about minutes for the newly added spinach to cook down and the result is great the veggie korma is probably the easiest to doctor up because it closely resembles a sweet thai curry sauce in our opinion anyway you can add any combination of steamed vegetables green beans broccoli asparagus carrots etc and protein chicken shrimp fish tofu etc and you will almost certainly come up with an excellent product as for comments on the rice it is all a matter of taste the basmati cumin rice packaged with the chana and korma is on the al dente side but this can be helped by adding a little water to the packet before you microwave and then cooking it a little longer the flavor is fine but not very intense our favorite is the basmati pilau rice packaged with the mutter paneer as it starts softer and has a little more flavor to it we do find that when our creations are done we sometimes need to steal the rice from an uncooked package and when we use plain old brown rice the next time it is not a huge loss finally one reviewer stated they had lots of sand or grit in their meals we have probably eaten of these so far with zero occurrence of any contaminants in our food i am giving the product stars because i feel it is an excellent tasting product that when purchased on sale think per case instead of is an exceptional value if you are a regimented cook who likes to follow the rules you may not enjoy the more relaxed method with which we experiment in that case you may wish to try these individually from the store before purchasing in bulk in any event i feel you will be pleased with the results even if you think you know better note i published the same review on the tiger tiger chana masala page too as it accurately describes all three of the tiger tiger products we have tried,1
this is wonderful stuff i used it to coat veg and then bake omg it is also good for french fries,1
i used to buy this candy at the when i was a kid ca not find it anywhere in the us anymore but it is well worth the premium to have it imported direct you pop one of these bad boys into your mouth and start sucking soon you are rewarded with fizzing flavor,1
these bags have lasted a long time i sprinkle them on salads or toast them up in the oven for a nutritious and tasty snack would purchase again,1
it would be very difficult to taste the difference between this and regular hellman is mayonaise and i think hellman is is the best you can buy no funny taste or funny after taste has the same texture and flavor of my favorite mayo and half the calories and no cholesterol it is worth a try,1
i use organic cocoa in shakes every morning and like to control amount of sweetening i add this is an excellent healthy product sold at a great price,1
i absolutely love these chips i can not understand after eating them why all potato chips are not baked instead of fried i think they taste better besides being healthier and i am very fond of these terra blues i like them much better than normal ones i hope amazon continues to carry them i get a count box once a month and these little bags are terrific helps one to monitor calories which really is not bad at all for calories yum,1
my dogs absolutely love these they are a bit pricey but seem to be good quality thanks dingo i have small dogs if you have larger dogs get bigger bones,1
i married into the japanese culture in my early twenties and over the past twenty years i have made some good strides in learning how to cook traditional japanese meals in a fairly authentic fashion chicken teriyaki is one of those recipes i think i do pretty well but now that the nest is empty and i cook for one i do not always want to break out a bunch of ingredients to enjoy a great meal in my opinion this marinade is by far the best tasting and very closest to authentic homemade taste that could possibly come out of a bottle this taste comparison includes going head to head to head with a really stellar recipe made by my mother in law who lived in japan for over years and had it down pat this marinade can also hold its own against several star restaurant versions i have had in nyc the flavor is perfectly balanced between the ginger soy and the sweet the only difference i see with this recipe and home made is the addition of the sesame seeds which i happen to love shake well follow the instructions on the bottle do not over marinate and you will have the best teriyaki dinner without any of the hassle,1
this sampler was a great way to try the various varieties of taza chocolate i am impressed very unique tasty flavors i also love that it is organic international coffee books packaging for this item was also impressive the box of chocolate was tightly packed in two layers of thermal bubble wrap with an ice pack thawed by the time it got to me but did it is job no melt,1
i just finished up my first bag of this coffee it is great i normally buy starbucks breakfast blend just so you know for comparisons purpose but i am switching to this brand it is just the perfect blend for me smooth but strong enough to wake me up,1
i first bought this peanut butter because i was looking for a healthier brand of peanut butter than the typical grocery store offered what attracted me to it was the fact that it was first of all organic but then i also found that i could get it in a no salt added version as well what a bonus i have to watch my salt intake to keep my blood pressure in check so this combination just could not be beat then i tasted it wow it tastes like real peanuts not some version of a mega processed what used to be a peanut flavor it is pricier than standard peanut butter but well worth it to get that close to nature to your health,1
my dogs are non verbal at least not in a language i understand so they did not have a lot to say about beneful but i take it as a two paws up when the bowl is empty soon after i fill it we have a pomeranian and a bichon and neither have ever had issues with weight but our bichon does tend to get rashes if she eats foods that do not agree with her we have generally just bought store brand dog food and that is been fine but they poop a lot because of the fillers i noticed with beneful they still poop every day but not as much and they seem much more energetic so we have decided to stick with beneful because the price is not bad and it works for our pups,1
excellent service and packaging is excellent and excellent quality and sent on timemy advice to deal with themexcellent service and packaging is excellent and excellent quality and sent on timemy advice to deal with them,1
our dog absolutely loves these chews they do not stain household surfaces and they have no offensive odors like some other dog chews bull pizzle for example the chews help to keep her teeth clean and the fiber keeps her regular i highly recommend these chews for your companion animal i would recommend starting out with a small trial order first since not all dogs seem to be so smitten with these like ours was one of our family members tried the chews with her dogs but they the dogs prefer traditional chews so we were actually first introduced to the chews by our relative and we have been ordering these ever since,1
my daughter does great on this formula plus i love it since it organic she was on a very gentle formula for her stomach prior to this and she has adjusted fine plus ordering on amazon it is priced right,1
i love brewed cacao beans so much to offer loaded with antioxidants flavor and great taste try it you will like it cream and sugar add to the delightful concoction,1

my husband has celiac disease and finding a good sandwich bread has always been a struggle this is a wonderful mix and i would highly recommend it,1
the package came on time and had everything that i ordered but the chocolate on the milk duds looks like it was old and was dried out and white ish not happy,-1
going gluten free is not easy however there are plenty of options that will get you close to eating traditional bread this is not one of them the cooking process is pretty accurate on the box the dough mix is almost pure liquid so you will need a pizza pan in my case i used a cookie sheet which was deep enough to not slosh over you cook the liquid mixture for minutes or so pull it out puncture the air holes and then cook some more toppings go on last and just long enough to melt the final product was almost inedible the dough is tough and chewy it does not cut without a knife because of the cookie sheet a pizza cutter would not get the edges and we had to push so hard to get through the fake bread leather that i dented the cookie sheet and destroyed it however the taste is worse than the texture the herbs and the mix itself make an almost bitter tasting dough the taste is just awful the crust crisped a little around the edges but was still tough there are better options out there try udi is rudi is or glutino products either as already prepared pizza or already prepared crust if you have a mellow mushroom in town try their pizza they are careful about cross contamination just do not get this one,-1
about out of every disks is bad to my knowledge there is no reasonable recourse tassimo will not pay to have the product shipped back if the original post office package has been opened how do you know a product is inferior if you do not open it tassimo refused to credit my credit card for unordered merchandise while their website was under revision refused to pay for unordered return package because the outside envelope had been opened so i could see what was inside etc i am stuck with the coffee maker until it no longer works their customer service was argumentative and their responses to my problems were not uniform resulting in serious delays confusion,-1
i signed up for the reoccuring monthly shipment of the oz vita coco both the peach mango and pineapple flavors i am very happy with the product itself however i only received boxes out of the advertised i would beware about buying the reoccuring shipments as you might not get everything you ordered i am not able to return the product and am trying to find out how to report this to amazon in the correct way buyer beware,-1
the bitterness in this tea is way too strong and the flavor weak it leaves a strange bad taste on the sides on my mouth when i drink it plain it is only really drinkable with milk and sugar or iced with sugar instead i would recommend trying a nice looseleaf black tea failing that try lipton is black pearl if you want a decent bagged tea that is easy to find twinings prince of wales is another good bagged tea btw orange pekoe does not refer to the flavor of the tea it refers to the size of the tea leaf pieces strangely orange pekoe is used for large pieces whereas this tea contains smaller pieces yielding more bitterness i am not sure why they use this term,-1
i would never ever ever buy this gum again not sure what extra was trying to accomplish here but i would advise you to buy a pack in store before purchasing it in bulk i am a gum lover i would not chew this if it were free it tastes chemically no identifiable flavor just ick,-1
the title sums it up the fern was withered when i opened it up did not make it a week tried nursing it back with no luck,-1
senseo sumatra blend neither smells nor tastes like true sumatra mandheling it tastes more like a stronger barely breakfast blend with an acidic aftertaste this is a bland boring characterless coffee in addition the senseo pods are very thin with very little coffee in them causing a very weak brew even on the oz setting for a much better sumatra mandheling stick to java one or molto,-1
i have ordered the snackmasters salmon jerky a number of times and have never been disappointed with the quality until today my co workers and i like to have a little salty treat in our otherwise very sugary snack station so i have taken to ordering the jerky when the shipment arrived today we expected the same as we have had before only this time it was awful i have read others reviews stating the jerky was hard as a rock and thought they exaggerated for effect i learned today they are not this will be the last time i order this product and i would hope that amazon would take to providing a little better quality control on items like this it is all fun and games til someone loses a tooth,-1
i have to give it star because they wont allow for any less this bacon dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet the chemical taste of the splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself i could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing this is one of the five walden is calorie free product i have tried and been very disappointed with i was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with splenda instead of stevia but for god is sake why make it soo unpalatable there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner my other reviews for these products may be around the same but darn i best just make my own dressing might not be calorie free but at least it will be consumable why make ranch sweet in the first place that is nasty,-1
i tried this because i had been reading it would increase breast milk but it did not do anything for me,-1
i thought these were going to be dried fruit turns out it is dried but full of sugar not what i needed taste is ok though,-1
sorry i do not like panning a product but there is no where else to go with this stuff the label is too small for me to read the ingredients and i do not seem them listed online other than in reviews one reviewer says it contains calories and grams of sugar print is so small i am reading with a magnifying glass each packet contains of your daily needs of chromium copper and zinc and of your daily requirement of selenium the eboost blend contains of acai fruit and green tea extract i will take their word for it i have no way to assess the health value nor did i feel any energy boost however i can tell you i did not like the taste it was very sweet but maybe not sugary which i also would not like but more of an artificial sweetener taste if you want sweet colored water with a nasty aftertaste this may be the drink for you otherwise try something like,-1
i have used a different brand of clothes moth traps before with great results unfortunately this time i decided to try the safer clothes moth traps the lure is a pain to get out of the little pouch without getting it all over your hands not a great idea unless you want moths flying at you and even if you manage to get it into the trap without getting it on your hands well our moths are completely ignoring the traps as though there was no lure at all what a waste,-1
i was so disappointed with this tea i bought a box during lunchtime looking forward to a nice cup of tea in the afternoon i made the cup and took a sip yuck it tasted fishy to me but could not figure out why tea would taste fishy so i read the ingredients i wish i had read them before the second listed ingredient is an oil blend of tuna oil soy oil and soy lecithin just the thought of tuna oil in my tea is enough to make me gag the actual taste is just as bad,-1
i ordered this thinking i would get a variety of different teas here is what i celestial seasonsings india spice bigelow mint bigelow pomegranate green celestial seasonsings sleepytime celestial seasonsings lemon celestial seasonsings english breakfast celestial seasonsings mandarin celestial seasonsings green teareally green teas i will not order this again in fact i am returning for a refund the teas were not packaged well they were just tossed into a paper bag,-1

it is my own fault that i did not realize i always buy the ounce and this is only ounce cans i have never even seen them in this small of a size i only buy them on sale so the price per can for the ounce is more than i normally buy the ounce for amazon will not allow you to return food even though this is cans and was still in the plastic wrap,-1
the chocolates were stale and certainly not worth the cost of the product would not purchase again,-1
i bought this jerkey for the first time and really disappointed about its taste it is too salty and tasted very old i can not believe that they shipped to me a very old jerky the shipment was delay too i will not buy it again from this company,-1
do not get me wrong i really wanted to love this as i had read so many great things about coconut water i was so excited when my order came i had some already in the fridge so it was cold after i had a great workout i went to grab my coconut water i was shocked at how disgusting the taste was i tried it again i tried it over ice i tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable if you have not had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case my next step is going to try and mix it with a variety of liquors and see if i can stomach it good luck,-1
rather than the complex creamy sauce you expect on butter chicken this tastes more like campbell is tomato soup with a few spices added flat artificial tasting and not buttery at all totally disappointing,-1

i have eaten this cereal for years no problems the last batch i purchased however was filled with worms subsequently i will not buy this product again,-1
this brownie mix came to us in a gift box and we loved them so we bought a case since then we have problems with them are they supposed to be oily and come out bubbly and liquidy i do not remember them doing that the first time it is like they separate baked on the edges and goo in the middle and it does not matter how long they are baked we still eat them but i wonder if there is something wrong or if we are doing something wrong,-1

unless you are used to eating this kind of food and enjoy it do not buy i read the reviews that the vegetable protein tasted like meat and would absorb whatever it was cooked in i cooked it in a meat sauce just to make sure it resembled meat and it did not at all ended up throwing it away and using ground beef,-1
a look at the seasoning ingredients and i thought i would love this mix organic jalapeno organic cilantro organic lime juice organic spices it is full of things i love however when i received the mix and tasted it i was overwhelmed i thought maybe it was just too concentrated so i also purchased a bag of the go raw naked seed mix and mixed them half and half there is just something off about the flavor it does not taste right i have only eaten them by themselves however so they might be okay if sprinkled on a salad but definitely not something i could just snack on by themselves i will not purchase them again,-1
when i received my last order both cases were full of bent cans while i would never have purchased a bent can atpet food or grocery store i decided not to return the order as it is so much trouble since i had a good stock of food for my cats i put the cases in cabinet unopened my six cats all eat rx science diet as their basic diet i use two cans of this daily split amoung them for treat two days after arrival of product i note a disgusting smellcoming from kitchen area two cans were so badly damaged they were open i threw the rest away i have a total of eight rescued animals all cats are alley cats and the dogs are mutts they are gold to me the cats are well cared for indoor pets obviously i clean constantly and support the clorine and disinfectant industry this was a disgusting experience for me i am canceling my monthly order now,-1

of the torino classical grissini thin bread sticks were broken into pieces otherwise the flavor is just a little better than the other grissini brands all the brands of the thicker bread sticks have a more natural and fresher flavor the thicker ones do not taste as artificial as the grissini i would have given this stars if most of the sticks were not broken,-1
we use ketchup packets in our lunches it takes several months to use up a box according to heinz the shelf life of ketchup packets is months the product i received is months old i will have to donate it to a food bank this is a good product but not fresh enough for extended use i will purchase at gfs after this i am very disappointed,-1
i bought this after all the glowing reviews and to be honest i do not get it it has a slightly bitter taste and really has a columbian coffee component to it overall i am really disappointed i previously bought coffee from another seller here and while neither of these was no where close to the best sumatra i have had the first one was definitely smoother i will give this another couple tries but if i can not get it straightened out i will not be buying this anymore and i will be asking for a refund,-1
there are way too many flavors going on in this breakfast cookie at least for my tastebuds whomever was in charge of adding spices really went too far to the point that it is actually nauseating obviously i will not be ordering this one again,-1
this product is not mild also it is bitter to the taste if you are looking for something mild this is not it it is a waste of money if you want something with great taste and a milder form try tobasco is brand of green pepper sauce in green bottle it does not have the bitterness of this product and it is readily available in supermarkets the shipping cost on this product is tantamount to highway robbery,-1
i really wanted to like these and on first inspection they seemed like a wonderful fluffy wheat bagel i toasted and slathered on a cream cheese salmon spread the first bite was ok a little different the second bite i better chew and swallow fast the the third bite threw up in my mouth a little bit had to spit it out they really seem lovely and if i was not such a bread connoisseur maybe i would not have known the difference it was kind of like chewing up a cardboard box you can chew for awhile until it gets nasty and then almost have to plug your nose to swallow if you can i am so sorry to give these a poor review because they really went to lengths to make a great product,-1
i tried this brand after having a successful experience with the simple brand and they did not measure up the baked chips are bland and they are coated in a film that changes their texture they are to thick and just do not satisfy chip craving as the calorie in take is identical to that of the simple brand i will stick with the latter which is amazing,-1
the lavazza brand of coffee does not taste anything close to this i lived in italy and bought this same product several times and the product from italy tasted a million times better the only thing that is close to the product is the package it smells horrible the color of the beans is too light and dull and it tastes so bitter and disgusting i would actually give the product zero stars if it would let me i will still continue to shop with amazon but do not recommend this product to anyone,-1
we have had trouble with every one of these k cups many of them have not had any air pressure in them and they make a mess all over have had this coffee before and like the flavor but that does not do me any good if the coffee is all over my counter and not in my cup,-1
when the plant arrived the packaging was not labled in any way do not crush or keep standing upright if this was done perhaps the little guy would of had some limbs upon opening it badly damaged,-1
i purchased these beans based on other reviews my plan was to make a premium vanilla extract for family members i purchased a very expensive vodka unusual bottles to fill and waited for my bean order to arrive i was not happy about the wait the beans arrived after the and i rushed to open the package i could not smell the beans as others reported most of the beans were skinny shriveled more dry and a great disappointment i would not recommend this product i will be looking for another source,-1
the only other flavored coffee i have used was nestle hazelnut it too was a whole bean i really enjoyed that one and thought i pick this one up where the nestle is shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers this one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related i like hazelnuts and this a is not anything like hazelnutnow i have of the stuff my mistake more info i am about of the way through the bag my opinion has not changed also i would note a very inconsistent flavor today is grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring it appears they really do not have the adding of flavoring down the intensity of the flavoring is all over the park,-1
nutrition facts posted by amazon list product as organic but it is not usda organic certified and nowhere on the box is the word organic listed,-1
the container itself is very strong but our lb springer spaniel chewed the rope apart in less than minutes so she could get all of the treats,-1
i bought several of these fertilizer pesticide stakes and was mildly disappointed in the product our garden has been over run by white flies lately and after reading these could kill them i bought packages and followed the directions in placing the stakes in my pots the product comes with a bunch of stakes and an applicator to place the stakes in your soil simple enough so i added stakes to each pot after a few days the plants looked greener from the fertilizer but the white flies were still out of hand after a week the flies were still there in great numbers so i applied another stakes to each pot fast forward weeks and the flies were still out of control as a fertilizer they work well but in my experience the have no effect on white flies which is unfortunate because it says right on the labelling that it kills them for the price i think you are better off looking at other options,-1
cyanocobalamin aka the dirtiest form of vitamin is in the product we wonder why cancer among kids is raising we are not eating food anymorebut synthetic toxic crap despicable bought it ounce will never buy it again you better off with an organic egg yellow preferably from a real farmeranswer methylcobalamin or even better hydroxocobalamin that is the best of the best do not come and post a reply that tells me that cyanocobalamin is safe according to the fda if you do not want to be flameddo you research and stop repeating like a parrot what other idiots are telling you,-1

i found this to be bland and lacking of flavor if you like weak mild coffee this one might be for you just did not do it for me,-1
our cats have been eating natural balance for a long time they like it and it is endorsed by our vet i started buying it at amazon recently to save a few cents a can and to have it delivered to my house since the cases of this can get heavy i buy cases at a time in both orders i have made i have had to throw away two or three cans because they are so badly damaged that i believe the seal is broken so i am not sure if i am actually saving any money in the last shipment one of my cases was can short and also had a damaged can or two in it so i only got about instead of the first time i ordered i thought this was a fluke but it happened on this last order also so shipping damaged goods is just part of their process,-1
if you are looking for granola bear naked is hands down the best nobody beats their quality and taste,-1
i ordered this product for my mom she was looking for flour but could not find it anywhere else than on amazon well i was very happy to get it for her but was disappointed when i received the package what was shipped is and not as shown on the picture i did contact the seller and asked him about it and they said that sometimes ingredients can be different than shown on the picture well this is not a question of ingredients but a totally different product after a few emails back and forth and after i had to contact amazon the funds were refunded,-1
my recommendation is to stick with the k cups that are not instant coffee for a few more bucks you can get real coffee k cups and flavoured ones as well i will not be buying this product again,-1
my husband loves the fortune cookies and was looking forward to receiving these when they arrived the box was crushed on two sides destroying over of the cookies the box was marked fragile but there was not packing inside to protect the cookies basically just fortune cookies in a cardboard shipping box very disappointed,-1

i was totally disappointed with this coffee i did not listen to few reviews that already mentioned this is crap if you are looking for good coffee this is not it that is all moreover you cannot return this item,-1
i thought this would be the best for our mocha beverages so foolishly i purchased bottles it does not taste at all like white chocolate it is very sugary and also seems to be more a peppermint flavor so bad we tossed bottles and are now using only fontana which will taste identical to starbucks beverages the vendor i purchased the ghirardelli from was aware of the taste issue years ago when i bought this the taste was awesome must be they changed a great recipe to now something so off i do not know how they can call it white chocolate sauce and put their label on it cheaper than fontana yes but you will get cheap quality too,-1
when cooking according to instructions in microwave it keeps making popping noises and eventually it pops really loud and flies up and spills all over the place at about secs in my microwave wtf it has done it to me three times in a row then i tried it in my sisters microwave and had the same exact problem i am not sure this stuff is even safe,-1
so i was looking for a healthier option than the oatmeal i was currently eating market pantry apple cinnamon reduced sugar this product has half the salt of my previous brand actually has more sugar but was not good at all i even tried adding at different times honey sugar and syrup none of these things helped this product was completely unpalatable and inedible i had other people try it and they had the same result i have just come across a way to make this edible adding peanut butter it is a simple fix but shows how it needs a complete flavor overhaul in order to be eaten i normally love whole grains i am not a sugar addict this product was just not good,-1
despite the two good reviews on this product from others i had to put my two cents in and make it known that this product is not tasty its texture is grainy which is not good for potatoes or chicken the chicken was overly dry and salty and the real turn off was the flavorless gravy i am not a picky eater nor a connoisseur of fine meals but if i had the option of eating this or starving to death i would starve to death especially with a pack of six i suggest you try it before you buy in bulk it really is not palatable imho,-1
i expected a bit more from the photo on the package we all know they exaggerate a bit but this was ridiculous i am not kidding there were maybe kernels of corn peas and broccoli no broccoli was in this there were some green flakes and maybe tiny dried tofu cubes the oriental noodles are spaghetti and mushy at that we did not overcooked them the flavor itself if tolerable if you get it be prepared to add a significant amount of veggies to it for it to resemble the photo on the packaging we will not be buying any of these products,-1
i ordered peeled plum tomatoes and received a pack of diced tomatoes instead every can has a dent in it which is not as big of a deal compared to not receiving what i ordered it would have been nice to have had the option of waiting on additional plum tomatoes if they were out of stock vs them sending me an alternate product not too happy about this,-1
wow this stuff is full body shake gross it has a very unnatural gross sweetness and i can not even find words to describe the disgusting mango pineapple flavor it sounded so good two of my favorite flavors and i love tea but i can not make myself drink another sip of this grossness wish i had not been roped in by the lightning deal this is going in the trash save your money,-1
i usually do not write reviews but compelled to do so this is not chow mein noodles my order has packs and all of them are small bits instead of lengthy noodles like how chow mein noodles is supposed to be this is like someone bought scrap noodle leftovers that are broken and made an item out of when i tried to return it says this item is not eligible for returns i thought all items bought from amazon are returnable well i learned my lesson the hard way stay away from this brand,-1
i use spry xylitol gum regularly for a variety of reasons i have tried all flavors and this is by far the worst with a strong artificial taste try one of the natural flavors two stars instead of one just because it is xylitol,-1

i researched this bone for days before finally deciding to spend the money on it i brought it home to my pound doberman and he was so excited about it when i finally got it out of the packaging my dog did not care at all about the bone he just wanted to play eat the package i spent time playing with him and the bone to create interest but still nothing it now sits in the bottom of his toy box,-1
the pudding is fine i have tried it before but this order arrived in a big box and several puddings had broken open and fruit flies had discovered them i had to throw out the entire case so it was a waste of money for me,-1
unbeleivable people are so gullible no these treats are not toxic to your dogs but they certainley are not healthy either just because sugar and fat taste good does not mean you should feed it to your dog get a clue and check out the ingredients in the treats and food you feed your dog and even though some things are healthy for humans does not mean they are for dogs e g soy and corn try thinking for yourself and doing your own research search dog food advisor,-1
i followed the directions precisely but the end result was the same as using other pre made gf crusts using a gf flour blend palm shortening ice water salt the crust looks and feels flaky but when the fork hits your mouth it dissolves into a grainy pasty mush you either need to spit out or drink a glass of milk to get down i do not know what needs to be added to give it the elasticity and ability to hold together but whatever it is this mix does not have it,-1
i bougt these for my diabetic girlfriend and they were not the hit i was hoping they would be she ate less than half the box in matter of few weeks and threw the rest away the taste was not good and she stated they left an aftertaste i would not recommend this although i do not know of any sugar free candy that does taste good,-1
when we first bought these we tried to eat one and could not looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts taste is awful our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell after about a week the contents of the bag start to mold since they are for the dog we washed them off and then store in the fridge too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc not recommended for people food,-1
i love green mountain coffee i use it all the time for my k cups i got a sample of the green mountain hot cocoa and thought it would be the best i actually threw it out i tried several times to drink it it tasted bitter and like chemicals i have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst i was so surprised because i adore their coffee i personally would not recommend this maybe it is the soy i do not know it just tasted very very odd i still would recommend their coffees though just to be fair i did add chocolate redi whip but i add that to all of my hot cocoa and it always tastes good,-1
i have not used this product specifically but research studies have indicated that xylitol an alcohol with a sweet taste can be harmful to dogs there are other products available that do not contain xylitol,-1
i did not realize that this actually had the bones in it not something that i would give to any dog let alone a yorkie and a poodle the bones take up a lot of room in the can the rest of the can contains little cubes of meat a few vegetables and lots and lots of gravy i usually split half a can between the two dogs the only way i am able to get another meal out of the can is to add more cooked vegetables the dogs really like it but i will not buy this flavor again you are getting less for your money since it contains bones and so much gravy i would recommend the turducken they absolutely love that one,-1
this product is not worth the money because the flavor only lasts about three minutes i have had many complaints about this gum when they pay a quarter to get gum i would suggest getting something different,-1
i had actually bought this at a supermarket store and went home to make a white mocha i usually drink starbucks so thats what i was going for to me this prduct is gross and not that good i really reccomend the fontana sauces and syrups that is the best product in my opinion and it is the same stuff starbucks uses,-1
i second this out of stars soupy and poor tasting october robert j mulholland franklin park nj united states see all my reviews real name there is so much watery sauce in this product it is tough to find the mini ravioli which are so small they barely fit anything inside unlike the picture on the outside of the bowl which makes them look packed with meat,-1
nope do not let this picture baby tears plant pot helxine seduce you into buying it i got a plant whose growth was parallel to the rim of the planter perhaps of an inch in height definitely not healthily overflowing as in the picture but i will not return the plant and pay another in postage to get rid of it i ot burnt and i have learned and maybe you can learn from my mistake,-1
the smackaroos diet treats garlic lob carb crackers arrived in a baggie not sealed and were stale,-1
first batch were great second batch reeked of bleach told amazon no return available so stuck with a bad box this one batch made me wonder how bad the quality control is for these green cow products decided not to take a chance again have never had these issues with the chunky chews brand,-1
i purchased this product because the pods looked like they were made in a more earth friendly way there is no hard plastic cup involved we break down our cups after use we compost the coffee and recycle the foil tops the plastic cups end up in the garbage this product arrives in several heavy plastic bags for freshness the filter pods are synthetic so they can not be composted and the tops seem to be made of plastic not foil the only thing i can keep out of the garbage is the coffee itself the coffee tastes good,-1
i have used and loved this product for years however they have changed the recipe it used to be pure date molasses but is now diluted and they have added sugar to it to make up for it it is not the same product and i now have jars that are unusable if you do not mind the sugar it might be fine but if you are looking for the pure date syrup this is not it anymmore,-1
i do not know if i am doing it wrong or if the kefir grains i have are not any good i have had the milk grains for about weeks and i am following the directions exactly the grains are actually growing but every batch that i have made has that rotten sour milk taste any tips that anybody might have that could save this batch or do i just chuck these and start a new the water grains i got you are doing great,-1
i had to throw out three of the bottles of the batch that i ordered because they contained ground glass i noticed it instantly when i drank from the first bottle and the bits of glass hit my teeth i ran the rest through a filter and even more came out two more had the same problem now i do not know what to do with the rest of it i do not know if there was a problem in the manufacturing of the glass or they were not stored properly or if the inside of the bottles got chipped somehow but to have three of them in the same batch is highly suspicious,-1
this gum is flavor lasted a total of about minute seriously the flavor is sweet and a little tangy it tastes good for the seconds that it lasts but honestly for minute what a piece of garbage will not be repurchasing,-1
i bought these bottles because i liked that they were bpa free and they looked comfortable they are awful there is a lip inside the bottle that is a pain and makes it feel cheap and the real reason i hate this bottle all broke my son would drop it and it shattered each and every time today i lost the last bottle and i am going to be calling evenflo tomorrow to complain now do not take this as a slam against evenflo i have the glass bottles and the very cheap bpa free bottles and those are all great but the comfit really are not built to last even though they cost the most,-1
it is pretty unbelievable that people use this stuff in lieu of chemical artificial sweeteners because it is good for you yet turns your bowels to water some say that you even have to get your body accustomed to the intake of this stuff use your heads people if this has such an adverse effect on your digestive system that you must condition your body to these bad effects then exactly how good for you is this stuff luckily i had the chance to try this before buying a lot of it if your idea of fun is being able to sh t through a screen door at paces and never leaving a stain then go for it but please refrain from telling me how good this stuff is for you,-1
i bought this for my dogs after finding beef lung treats at costco my dogs love them i should have read the details better for this product i looked at the picture and thought it said lbs it is only oz though for i got a lb bag of beef lung at costco this oz container is worth maybe a dollar or two not a good value,-1
compared to other fussie premium cat foods we tried this seems to have less in the can we had them in different occasions and cans do not have as much food so our cats feel hungry very soon,-1
this shampoo is a cream shampoo that claims to nourish the scalp but the second ingredient sodium laurel sulfate is a known scalp irritant the shampoo is also tinted pink as is the matching conditioner i do not like using hair products with dyes because they stain my hair it is also heavily scented i will not use it again and i would not recommend it for anyone else,-1
worst tasting peanut brittle ever if it even earns the rating to be classified as peanut brittle it simply just does not taste the way good peanut brittle should taste at first glance it looks good in appearance but do not let that fool you it tastes absolutely awful of plastic preservatives with peanuts,-1
i am disappointed in that i cannot really taste the hazelnut flavor the coffee is also light,-1
i tried it a few times first to just try then again to compare against nespresso capriccio green pod which has an intensity of and is made like the ecc is expressivo arabica and robusto mix the nespresso capriccio is not my favorite because it is relatively weak then i tasted the expressivo i was amazed how much weaker an espresso can get and to legally call it espresso folger is makes much better coffee and i think folger is is boring i like the environmental friendliness of this company but it has to make a better tasting product this stuff was horrible i still have pods to drink i guess i will give it away to my environmentalist friends as a gift so disappointed,-1
that irresistible dickensian odor as it warms british culinary experience is not world noted from london is bangers and mash to liverpool is scouse to glasgow is haggis this isle of bad teeth is not normally sought for its kitchen fare and so within this small can it comes to us in dickens we read of the ravenous appetites consuming the most bizarre items of tiny tim is bag of lard boiled with brandy and a plum of whatever it was fagin gave his small boys in london is slums here we share a taste of those delights do not let this discourage you let a can of this sit opened in a pan of bubbling hot water alongside a can of evaporated milk this in itself makes an adequate holiday pot pourri filling your house with cozy warmth and this is undoubtedly the only safe manner to consume it olfactory rather than gustatory considering the transfats sugars and flour remember my child the warm mothering spirit of adele davis she of best thing since indian pudding,-1
i am so tired of companies claiming their products are gf when they are not most of the items in this product are cross contaminated i have celiac this is not a diet fad for me believe me i miss all my gluten foods the government needs to step up and regulate the products better gluten free should mean just that no ing gluten,-1
i was very disappointed in the taste of these cookies they seemed dry and did not taste as yummy as i thought they should,-1
i have a small mini fridge and wanted to put some baking soda in there to remove some of the odors that were starting to build cut open the top of the bag and within hours all the smells were gone i think the pack is a very good buy especially at that price,1
this product has better grade materials used to create it than other general feed brands such as fri kies m x etc because they are essentially just a bunch of fillers this has at least some chicken meal as the main ingredient setting it far above them in quality at a price of for its less than a dollar pound and the cheapest food prices i have seen are around cents per lb so its a great price considering its quality you can use this as a filler mixed in with better brands if your cats dont get snobby and refuse to eat the cheaper stuff when better food is in the bowl with it diamond makes another version,1
so we first bought this for a batch of home brewed beer then found out it tastes great and can be substituted in so many recipes we will be continuing use of this product,1
pop a can overnight in the fridge the next day open and pour into a bowl the gelatin hardens it to the consistency of a very soft jello sprinkle with fresh lemon juice maybe some chives and serve before it warms up and starts to melt admittedly the idea of beef jello takes some getting used to so i would suggest a small serving size the first time you try it btw eating it involves a certain amount of slurping since it slides around on the spoon,1
this does not taste at all like cough syrup as the other reviewer stated this is the best gum out there and i highly recommend it i am not a plant i live in austin tx and bought a pack of this in san antonio i just ordered a box on amazon this and the lemon are the best flavors orbit makes john,1
this is the best full flavored coffee i can find for k cups and amazon has the best price k cup coffee appealed to us because my wife and i have such different tastes ironicly my wife likes the second cup through the little k cup of grounds after i get the powerful drink of the first cup,1
i first had somersaults when i purchased a snack pack on a delta flight the box came with a oz package of these santa fe salsa somersaults yum the crunchy bites are each about the size of a nickel but thicker they are crunchy a little salty and a little spicy the most promenent flavor is sunflower seeds the main ingredient so if you do not like sunflower seeds this is not the snack for you the sunflower seed flavor is not overwhelming by any means though most impressive was the list of ingredients that you can actually pronounce these are not gluten free though in case you were wondering the first few ingredients sunflower seeds wheat flour whole wheat flour sesame seeds vital wheat gluten nutritional content in a oz package calories are from fat mg sodium g carb g fiber g protein so i would not down a big bag and expect this to still be considered a healthy snack but i think it is good in moderation i ordered the same snack pack on the flight home just to get another pack of these somersaults i plan to try more of their flavors they have a new cinnamon flavor that sounds pretty good for a sweet snack at first i was just going to order big bags but then i started thinking about the temptation to finish out a bag of these in one sitting so i may stick to the smaller packs,1
reasons that i decided to purchase my kap now were save the environment i hate it whenever i throw out used k cups in such a good condition one time use save money although k cups cost much less than a visit to starbucks it costs per cup and it adds up i get to choose to brew from any coffee of my choice i can brew from beans purchased in costa rica nicaragua and etc best of all brew it right after i grind the beans fresh after my kaps arrived i can not wait to use it to brew the next reasons that i love them thanks to the clear instructions sent with my kap it is easy to get started assemble and dissemble the coffee brewed from reused k cups with my kap tastes great to the essence of your grinds unlike bad reviews i have read for similar product even better i can change the strength of my coffee by adding less or more onto my reused k cup it does leak but not too much or too messy i do not know exactly the reason or ways to prevent it from happening i am still playing with it but the leaks are not messy because they still go into the cup i just have to remember to wipe the machine after brewing i do that as a routine regardless it leaks anyway do it does not bother me for the quality of the brewed i get the money and wastes i saved i am very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommended to anyone who shares my desires to save environment save and has a freedom to brew different coffee each day not just different but fresh if you recently grind the beans or grind right before you brew it,1
the box arrived damaged there were actual holes in the cardboard shipping box with one large enough for me to fit my entire wrist hand through alarmed i opened the box and other than a couple of what looked like grease stains on the inside of the box the individual bags were thankfully intact a quick phone call to amazon and they were kind enough to make a generous adjustment and noted my comments on the packaging for further investigation kudos to amazon for their usual excellent customer service the stacy pita crisps themselves were none the worse for the harrowing journey they survived deliciously i have tried several varieties of the stacy pita crisps but these are a sweet treat the cinnamon sugar pita crisps are a sinful pleasure with the right amount of crunchiness and sweetness i try to justify this indulgence by telling myself they are baked not fried there are studies as to the health benefits of cinnamon which may or may not be valid but they are certainly yummy if not healthy when i opened the box it looked like a lot for one person but i am embarrassed to say they did not last me long enough the individual portions seem small but the crunchiness takes time to chew so it makes them last longer the subscribe save price was an excellent value over regular retail,1
i cant say anything bad about the selection of coffee i receevid i am having fun every morning deciding what flavor should i have today,1
this stuff is fantastic it is a finely chopped giardiniera i mainly use it as a chicago style hotdogs and an italian beef topper i purchased it locally in chicago and liked it so much that i figured i would check amazon so i could have a few bottles shipped to me on vaction unfortunately the resellers on amazon only have it available by the case and the price it completely outragious for so they want a bottle i can get it at the grocery store for a bottle oh well,1
these tortillas taste great and are easy to make the best part is that they have actual taste they are definitely not a rubbery white rice disc like other gf tortillas i have tasted nor are they a large brown rice cracker i made the mistake of trying brown rice tortillas before i learned how sick they make me i have to be gluten free fructose free and dairy free these tortillas are a game changer for those of us who are gluten free but can not have brown rice because of the fructose content my husband and i used to make mexican food several times a week it was basically just our way of life before i was diagnosed with fructose malabsorption and a gluten sensitivity for the past years i have missed tortillas and mexican food more than anything finally i can eat my steak burritos again i would very highly recommend these to anyone who like me is constantly struggling to find something to fit into a very complicated diet with competing intolerances the ingredients are simple but well balanced and the result is a very tasty tortilla they do not really taste like wheat flour tortillas but they are way closer than any other rice tortilla i have had and they are flexible and soft i would never have guessed that this unassuming tiny brown bag would hold so much yummy goodness it would seem more fitting packaged in a golden bag with ribbons and balloons tied to it that would more accurately portray the fantastic osity of its contents here are a few things we have learned about making these we like to store them individually wrapped in foil and frozen first we cook them then allow them to cool in a ziploc bag in the fridge spread them out on baking sheets and flash freeze them and then individually wrap them you can take them straight out of the freezer one at a time and toss them in the oven or on the bbq indirect heat or you will turn them into crackers and they come out warm and soft keep them tightly wrapped in the foil while you re heat they take about minutes to warm up from frozen solid to warm soft and delicious i am sure they do well in the microwave too but we have not tried that yet the instructions say as you are cooking them to put them from the pan directly into a large ziploc bag and keep it sealed my husband and i were pretty hesitant about that it seems really wrong as you are making them because they are so hot right off the griddle but do it anyway it gets and keeps them good and moist you can always dry them out when cooking but you can not re add the moisture last i found that putting between cup and just a hare shy of cup of water helped to adjust for the high altitude instructions they are really hard to roll out if you make the mix too moist so start on the dry side and add water by the teaspoon if necessary oh and you will need lots of tapioca flour to roll them out with we get tortillas out of one bag of mix the only way these tortillas could be any better is if they sold them pre made and frozen i would literally buy them by the case and happily pay extra for cold shipping to get them to me thank you so much new grains it sounds cheesy but really these have made a huge difference in my diet and therefore my life it is been so nice to eat a little more like i used to and new grains please do consider selling them pre made we would be customers for life,1
i do not know what other teas people are drinking for this review but for me there is no aftertaste it has just the right amount of sugar without being overly sweet you really taste the blueberry flavor i have stopped drinking sodas and have gone to drinking steaz teas the peach and lime pomogranate are very good as well try picking one up at your local grocery store to see if you like it then go to amazon and buy by the pack for a better deal,1
these are similar to what you find in the grocery store they will do but read my other review on porcini mushrooms i just purchased whole sliced porchini mushrooms on amazon and those are spectacular wow these are fine and the price is great but not like the other porchino is i purchased on amazon,1
these are delicious and also a healthy snack for your kids no artifical ingredients or high fructose corn syrup,1
i love these on the go bottles when i am out and about with my baby girl the fact that they do not need to be refrigerated or heated makes them particularly convenient just attach a sterilized nipple and go,1
i knew from previous experience that this candy is small and not the greatest for blowing bubbles however the flavor is simply delightful even though it lasts little more than seconds my personal favorite by far is the strawberry flavor i bought this variety pack because i would never tried the orange or melon flavors i did not think they had as good a flavor and the flavor was not as intense as the strawberry or grape anyways i think y all should try this at least once in your life,1
it is got a really good flavor but it is very very weak i left the teabag in for the entire half hour or so that i was drinking it and it was never really strong enough on the plus side it never got bitter either so if you drink your tea in fairly small cups and do not like it too strong this might be the one for you on the other hand if you are looking for a strong flavorful cup of chai i would keep looking for me i will finish the package but i might not buy it again i will also be trying two bags per cup there are other tea district flavors that are amazing so i will keep trying others in this brand also this price is about half the price of my local retailer,1
sometimes seeds dont germinate well no biggy for when seed packs from most dealers like burpee will cost on average around so you spend for a nice planter one with a low profile to keep the cats from koing it onto the floor and rolling in the dirt my cats dig my mums out when i bring them in from the cold and they knock my smaller pots down so i will be purchasing these types of products to distract them i believe the cat grass is an annual and wont keep growing and growing but then i didnt research this if the cats eat it all down it might die just like grass that is cut too low but wouldnt it come back i will have to pull my books out,1
i have drank tea for years and constantly re order this brand i have a tea pot that i add this tea and matcha green tea together and love the taste i have at least cups a day i highly recommend this tea and brand,1
i will admit it i want it all i am enough of a foodie to want to eat only good things and when my schedule or circumstances do not permit a delightful meal or freshly prepared snack but i need something to keep me going with my kids or work this is my go to product the chocolate tastes like chocolate the protein does not taste or act like some kind of terrible cardboard or sawdust and the peanut butter is mild and helps carry through a feeling of i kinda just had a candy bar but my tum tum feels like i just ate a big ol bowl of pasta for price and convenience you can not beat the subscribe and save price and delivery to your home or office,1
best price i have found this is the best mint tea i have found this deal is better than what i have found from the retailers i would purchase this again,1
we used to buy baby goldfish crackers for our toddlers until we found these we bought a whole case and our toddlers love them it took about a month for our little girl to stop calling them sishy crackers she couldnt tell a difference in my opinion they tast better than goldfish crackers they are not as salty tasting i think we have these with at least meals a day not to mention snacks i love snacking on them too a great snack for the whole family,1
the first drink made me a little bit nervous it is pretty strong though i guess that cappucinos generally are it seemed to mellow out a bit after the first drink and was really quite enjoyable i am a regular coffee drinker and this did not wire me or keep me up all night so it must not be much stronger than a normal cup of coffee i am not sure about the relative caffeine contents it may even be less overall very enjoyable if you try it i hope you like it as well and thanks for taking the time to read my review,1
i was a little hesitant to order ths since grade b is described as having a stronger flavor than grade a and often used in cooking i am delighted to report the flavor is not to strong and is perfect on pancakes and waffles this syrup is of excellent quality at a good price and i will continue to order it i pity those folks out there who think log cabin or mrs butterworth is is what you are supposed to use on your pancakes,1
coffee bean eye cream is great to use under your eyes in the morning it gives you a now i am awake look goes on very smooth and has a nice cooling feel,1
wow it is not often that anything comes along that just completely takes over my cravings a coworker of mine asked if i had tried these she said it seemed like something i would like i had heard of wasabi peas and they were okay but i had never heard of sriracha nor any green peas coated in the stuff boy was i blown away i can not stop eating these things and at or more at a pop per can at our local grocery store winn dixie in the mexican aisle i might have stumbled upon a very expensive habit akin to nicotine addiction or alcohol unbelievable you pop these in your mouth a dozen at a time and your tastebuds are lovingly stimulated with a mixture of sweet garlic y spicy delights they are somewhat spicy and full of flavor who would have thought that green peas could taste so good i keep waiting for the msg induced migraine that just will not come because i suffer from those quite regularly when i indulge in something delightful and sinful so far so good i have even gone online and found recipes for sriracha sauce to try and make my own chicken marinade it is like discovering a new meaning to life unreal bought several different kinds of peppers at another local grocery store publix and will try my hand at making my own sauce i am amazed,1
my cats have been on this food for the last years after their previous food made them ill if you remember the pet food recalls a few years ago it was around the same time but it was a cat food that was not recalled i did research and i found this food at the time was perfect for cats so we gave it a try and this is what i my cats do not particularly care for the stuff but they eat it anyways why is this good because it means they eat when they are hungry not because it tastes good or they are bored they have lost maintained their weight impressively over these my cats teeth are in great condition their coats are silky and less food in and higher quality ingredients means less waste out i have noticed a huge decrease in litterbox use so we go through less litter some of the reviews talk about cats developing issues from eating this food it is not necessarily the food to blame maybe the cat would have developed those issues anyways and it is always best to work with your cat maybe this is not the right food for them that is always a possibility but it is the right food for my cats and i suggest giving it a try i suggested that to a friend and she did her cats hated the stuff they would not even consider eating it even after days of no other food options obviously that means it is not going to work for them,1
these sugard cubes and indeed white and made of sugar but i can only interpret european style and cubes to be a contradiction in terms these cubes are not in fact remotely cube like i would not recommend them for display purposes for the the construction of small delicious igloos i would however recommend them for insertion into cups of tea and any other foodstuffs that needs sweetened up sharply and without remorse make no mistake these things are pure sugar and are absolutely effective at their stated goal sweetening up the world,1
i have not tried the plain one but the berry one taste very good i found them on sale at kroger is and bought bottles they taste like yogurt but a little bit more sour and it is liquid love it and would recommend but the original price is way too expensive i think a bottle is would be about right,1
i happened upon these chips at a local discount store and thought that i would give them a try these are the first chips that i could really say you can not eat just one i went back and bought all they had left then when they were gone i was thrilled to find them on amazon try them you will not be disappointed,1
both a novelty and practical purchase my girlfriend goes through this stuff like water so we bought this cheaper per ounce etc it is actually so cool looking we have not cracked it open yet though,1
we love the ease of the k cup and the kona is definitely the favorite of the medium roast coffee drinkers in our office one of my co workers was leaving on vacation and was sad that she did not get to have any until she returned from vacation,1
this is good licorice i recommend them note that they are not for your typical us tastebuds mix of black licorice and salt,1
great product for organizing k cups my counter looks much tidier and i like having my favorite flavors right there with the machine i have not had any significant issue with the drawer catching or being hard to open and am pleased with the overall value,1
the swiss chocolate almond is the only coffee i have in the mornings since my family discovered red buffalo in or we did try the same flavor description from four other vendors in the past we are repeat customers simply because the flavor is perfect unlike anything else with a similar description made by other coffee vendors this last time we ordered we ran out and had to be satisfied with another brand and there just were no happy mornings for the adults in this family those two mornings this particular coffee is fully flavored but has pretty overtones with just the right amount of hmmm sweetness to make it not need additional cream or sugar the aroma is out of this world it is not harsh like the coffee from that company with the green circular logo that has the drive through window that coffee could grow hair on your chest this coffee does not irritate my stomach with acidity like other brands have done in the past i do not get jittery either each package is sealed and labeled and can be resealed but i use a rubber sealed canister the packages red buffalo ships make beautiful thoughtful gifts i buy the ground version but i seem to remember that the whole bean was once ordered by us by mistake and the coffee was just as good either way we know that life needs a few special touches and this coffee certainly helps,1
my high energy siberian husky loves only this teeny tiny kibble she wolfs down the larger kibble and gets a tummy ache this wonderful dog food might actually have a higher quality fat content i could be mistaken maybe that is why it is so appealing so tasty to my high energy husky i prefer this food to the other brands there is less input and less output both with high quality food the inexpensive grainy food ends up being eaten in greater quantities and of course more mess more clean up after wards ew,1
i read the health benefits of red bush tea in a few articles that is why i placed my first order the taste is great my kids drink this and add agave nectar for some sweetness i have now ordered my second batch from amazon,1
the best candy ever share with a friend of mine who is american he loves them eats a box in a couple of hours,1
after seeing this on tv i gave it a try first off shipping was fast as for how it taste i could not believe how good it is i use it every morning in a drink its almond milk soy protein powder and the powered peanut butter you half to try this,1
i have been clean and sober almost yrs and never got into energy drinks but the local wal mart was giving free samples small cups so i took one i felt kind of tired but after drinking just a small cup felt great body and mind so i bought a pack they only have grape and i have never liked grape anything but it was o k but kind of expensive for drinks but i figured if that tiny cup made me feel nothat good each tube would last me a while i gave stars because in my experience when it gets too hot the tube on two occasions i put one in my pocket pulled it out later to pour into a cold bottle of water and even though i poured some of the water out of the bottle it fizzed up and out and made a mess i think the good stuff gets lost when this happens has only happened when it was hot and i did not feel anything after no zipp like it all came out i am going to try just drinking the amount i drank in the isample cup maybe drinking the whole tube is too much for me becasue i noticed i get almost wired and that is something i do not want to be any more just feel good,1
my finicky cat who needs a pill everyday eats these babies up medication delivery is soo simple now,1
these are one of my absolute favorite foods just add cheese and green onion on a toasted bunand you have a little slice of yum easy to make and quick too jaime pico,1
my cat seems to like to chew and so since he is a large cat he loves this dog green chews i never find any left on the floor he has good breath too,1
key recipe ingredient does a great job stores well pack makes it convenient as it is really hard to find in local supermarkets,1
kashi is heart to heart is by far my favorite cold cereal the crunch and the fact that it stays crunchy in soy milk makes it perfect the honey flavor is very mild and the cereal has an almost maple taste to it and the cereal is made with whole grains how perfect is that one week i ran out of the heart to heart and grabbed a box of cheerios at target it was such a disappointment it did not stay crunchy and the flavor was just flat i was grateful when my next subscribe save shipment arrived while the cereal is mighty tasty with milk it also makes an excellent snack to eat out of hand update this cereal is no longer available on subscribe save,1
i absolutely love these healthy and yummy with an awesome texture texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks and these have an awesome soft texture they are not hard and you do not have to sit there chewing forever but if you want you can suck not them and they will not just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth they are perfect this flavor is my favorite but i recommend trying the tropical flavor as well the only possible negative comment i have for these is that they are very expensive another great fruit snack to try if you like the texture of these is ocean spray brand they are not organic but they are less than half the price of annie is i like the ocean spray berries and cherries flavor the best,1
my dog chewed it up made it disappear in about minutes while i was emptying the box he definitely likes it but its a little costly to go so fast,1
i was almost surprised about how chocolaty the tea was i mean it is a tea i expected a hint of it but this is really nice and very rich with some milk and sugar it is almost like drinking white hot chocolate very nice treat,1
i love it but the store i shop at stop selling it and i am not happy about it cause they are the only ones that carry it but it is some good stuff i just wish i could buy it when i need it but it has good flavor and taste,1
very crunchy clove and ginger cookie the only problem i had is that they are a little too salty for my taste,1
not mutch to say but my wife and i are both on a diet and we are trying to drink only water water gets very boring after a short time and i love this fruit punch stuff we keep a gallon made at all times and its pretty much all we drink we get it off amazon for almost half what you pay at giant eagle then we sav any extra for auto reorder ca not say enough,1
this is one great scotch it is smooth and very much like old english scotches i love it,1
my son loves these soups particularly the butternut squash bisque i am a little confused that other reviewers said it lacked texture for a stage food it is soup people not even adult soup is necessarily chunky i think it is a great transition from stage to i would also say that babies on stage could probablyhandle these items,1
after reading the reviews i purchased this elk antler for a lb golden retriever she is quite the expert chewer i finally found something that could not chew in seconds kept her interest not stink like bones from the butcher and safe i was also very suprised by the massive size of the antler i received it is the diameter of my wrist and the length of my forearm i cannot recommend this product highly enough,1
i have cats pro plan chicken and liver entree is one of the few canned foods that all of them will eat if my picky eaters like it i suspect most cats would like it i do not like the fact that it contains artificial flavor but at least chicken is the main ingredient and it does not contain grains,1
love these cause they taste like a payday bar the only compliant i had was when i ordered them i was expecting them in days prime member and instead they sat in a warehouse all weekend long during the time we were having degree temps so when the finally got to the house days later they melted and stuck to the wrapper if it was not for that i would have no complaints but i do have a subscription so i will be getting more of them i use these as meal replacement when i am on the go,1
bialetti trends collections has had my vote since i bought my first ceramic saute pan the color of the plum or purple is super looks so great sitting out on top of the stove works even better cooking with it clean up is a breeze will be collecting more of bialetti trends in the near future amazon has done a great job on having super items to choose from amazon and bialetti are a great team thx so much,1
these tomatoes i use for italian marinara sauce they have no salt and it is just crushes ripened tomateos so you can add as much salt to your dishes as you desire also great for chili when you do not have fresh tomatoes if you would like some nice recipies just ask,1
my dog loves these because they are food i love them because they have no beef which my dog is allergic to best of all these fit well into kongs many dog treats seem to have shrunk in the last year which defeats the purpose of the kong these are a winner and all natural,1
gloria jean coffee of hazelnut is just great i do not drink anything but hazelnut all the other coffees seem to be to strong i just love it,1
the nutcracker sweet tea is perfect for the holidays unlike some other holiday themed teas that i have tried this one is not just a regular unflavored tea with holiday packaging rather nutcracker sweet is a truly holiday tea it has hints of cinnamon and nut and while it is hard to describe it tastes like what you would expect a christmas tea to taste like wrapping up the flavors of the season in a hot tea i would highly recommend it turn on some christmas music heat up a cup of this tea and sit by the fireplace or christmas tree hard to beat that,1
great size to take for travel car rides camping to work etc when you want a quick and healthy breakfast on the go good slightly sweet taste and tons of fiber,1
the dogs love them and they do a good job of cleaning the dogs teeth when used regularly,1
i am a gourmet cook i started using this packaged dinner because it is so much easier to make than using my mom is long receipe i just follow the directions and add okra craw fish shrimp and crab and this is a great dinner,1
i really like this matcha green tea i have tried other organic brands of matcha green tea but they do not mix well and clump this also tastes great,1
this product is perfect for baking and for making dry rubs it adds a great flavor to coffee and tea as well just wish that it were a little cheaper,1

this tea in a silken bag is high quality small whole leaf tea and has a fragrant fresh foliage taste none of the off fulsome taste in many senchas and you can taste all the different elements of tea almost floral even though no flowers are apparently added the bag can be steeped twice if desired this tea is hard to find thanks amazon for carrying it even if sporadically from my earlier review most bagged tea is almost by definition not of the best quality because the little pile of tiny pieces or even powder protected only by porous paper and exposed to the air has a large surface area and is quickly oxidized the more subtle aromatics are gone in a day or two once the seal on the box is broken these tradition whole leaf teas are each sealed in an individual plastic packet and the leaves although not really whole are much larger than most bagged tea and a beautifully preserved green leaf the well stuffed bags appear to be made of silk no staples hard to tear one bag really can be used for more than one cup and the taste and aroma is more fragrant than almost any green tea i have tried including some pricey premium whole leaf teas i love this tea their oolong tea is pretty good too lower on the fermentation scale than many but good i would avoid the jasmine green as it is fine but the flowery fragrance of the straight green is enough for me the jasmine seems like overkill almost like perfume,1

i recently discovered snapple apple while i was in boston on visit for a funeral snapple apple has a unique taste to it almost as if you are biting into a beautiful red delicious apple skin and all i liked it so much i went back nearly every day i was at home to purchase more as i was not aware they sold it out in california where i reside i am not sure what the other reviews are for since i did not taste pear in my drink i also love the snapple fruit punch which is quite refreshing as well when served crisp and cold from the freezer or from a ice bath which is how i kept mine in the hotel respectfully reviewed,1

it is difficult to find a dark chocolate for baking purposes mousse or to spread it over a buche de noel for example this chocolate was great melted really well without lumps and had the perfect taste of a baking chocolate the pieces are very large and chunky and you may need to cut them before use overall very happy with it,1
i bought this caviar to share with my year old grandmother she felt like a queen when i told her we were going to have caviar together i was impressed with the careful packaging and their ability to keep the caviar at the appropriate temp while shipping,1
please take the numbers in this review with a pinch of salt and maybe a little butter my pack came today the directions said that a serving was tablespoons so i took one tablespoon of each of the three varieties and put them in my very old hot air popper and turned it on it popped fine with only a few un popped kernels and the number of old maids more numerous but also very small perhaps of the number that i get with regular popcorn the popped kernels are about half the size of regular popcorn when popped but the that is to be expected since they are about the size when it starts out the flavor of all three varieties is good and i could tell that there were at least two different varieties based on the taste i could not distinguish between the three varieties visually but i did not do a careful inspection i just grabbed a handful and glanced at it as i was putting it in my mouth i used about half a tablespoon of melted real butter and a decent size pinch of salt i thought the three tablespoon serving was reasonable perhaps not as much as i usually eat by volume but probably slightly more than i usually eat in terms of number of kernels i will try some tomorrow popped in oil and post an edit to this review in summary it is a touch pricy for popcorn but the flavor is slightly different from grocery store popcorn and i would buy it again especially with free prime shipping,1
these are very crunchy and have a wonderful bbq taste i love these chips and this flavor is great i have purchased these in jalapeno as well,1

i was pleasantly surprised at how this worked in my popcorn machine the glaze dissolved nicely into the oil and coated the kernels evenly the candy coating adds an extra crunch to the popcorn and the mild red hots flavor does not overwhelm i am will be trying the carmel and chocolate glazes next,1
these have a wonderful texture and with some bacon drippings make terrific refried beans with your blender an excellent choice for anyone trying to cut carbs these beans are packed with protein and fiber and they are absolutely delicious in chili bean salad and any other recipe calling for black beans the was an excellent value as well i did find these beans in my local supermarket but it was more expensive per can i will definitely be ordering these again,1
this was some of the best american sturgeon caviar i have tried in terms of taste and even texture although the texture still falls short of the imported roe for the price however even with the big shipping cost to ca it can not be beat i would order from this company again,1

this product was priced very reasonably for pet owners that need to give their pets pills these pockets can not be beat,1
by that i do not mean it was grown by free range hens or plucked from the lush fertile soil of virgin canadian tundra what i mean is that you had better chew slowly lest you find your dental work impinging upon bits of sand and grit directly from canada my tub tasted somewhat more fully than the nutiva organic shelled hempseed lb bag but the nutiva lacked the sand and grits all told it is a toss up between the two i will probably go with nutiva next time despite the higher price as so not to put my teeth and dental work in jeopardy,1
absolutely love these cookies perfectly soft delish taste just great kids love them too just ordered more for treats here and there at home and for school treat time when all the kids are eating something my son can not have he is not missing anything when he has these o,1
i used this extensively in baking my cookies are incredibly better with this stuff it is very addicting i mostly made cookies with this substituted for vanilla extract they tasted better and people would gobble them up i also added it to french toast that was incredible too this lasted me about months with baking every week or every other week i plan on buying it again but buying a much bigger container this time if you are hesitant about this i would recommend trying it i ran out and do not like to eat my cookies as much without it just a fantastic product,1
its one of my fav flavors wish i cld still get it in stores locally its just one of many vitamin water flavors that have up and disappeared,1
