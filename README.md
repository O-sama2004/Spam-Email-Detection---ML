At Yıldız Technical University, I completed a project comparing three key optimization algorithms in machine learning: Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM). Implemented in C and visualized with Python, the project evaluated each algorithm's performance in terms of loss, accuracy, and computation time.

Highlights:
 - Implemented GD, SGD, and ADAM to analyze their efficiency and convergence.
 - Created functions for data handling, preprocessing, and performance tracking.
 - Demonstrated ADAM's superior convergence and stability.

Technologies Used:
 - C Programming
 - Python for Data Visualization
